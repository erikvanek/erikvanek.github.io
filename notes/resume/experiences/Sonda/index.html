<li>helping to organize a full evening audiovisual festival</li>
<li>event was sold-out despite being kicked-off for the first time</li>
<li>my main responsibility was to ensure that everything runs smoothly according to plan</li>
<li>also I was available for artists for whatever was needed</li>
<li>This small [[stage-management-kit]] helped me during this day</li>
