<ul>
<li><strong>JTBD is a theory</strong>, that should be able to describe what happened in the past but also what might happen in future</li>
<li>provides <strong>a framework for finding out what the user really wants</strong> and what causes them to a given purchase or usage of a product or a service</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>a job is the progress an individual is trying to make</strong> in a particular circumstance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everytime we're on <strong>a path to transform our life to something else</strong> - we have a Job to be done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Job</em> is shorthand for what an individual really seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance</p>
<ul>
<li>When we buy a product, <strong>we essentially “hire” it</strong> to help us do a job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>a JTBD does not surprisingly appear – <strong>it is properly designed</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JTBD is the <strong>process one goes through in need to transform an existing life situation into a preferred one</strong> but cant because of existing constraints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare JTBD versus user stories <a href="https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is <strong>best used at the early stages of a product design</strong> process it will help you identify innovate and grow your product. It looks at the bigger picture of possibilities and options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JTBD can be visualised with a storytelling arc - [[Inciting accident]] can be the first exposition to the means that can get the job done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an inspiration can be found in [[Activity-centered design]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a guiding star to JTBD is the customers' [[Motivation]] to better their lives</p>
<ul>
<li>focusing on functionality will distract you</li>
<li>e. g. going to a theatre with a kid is not only about the act, but also about making <em>their lives better</em> by having a shared experience so that they can talk about concepts and share life lessons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>customer jobs <strong>don't tell me which innovation to make</strong> but what are my m customers struggling with; it helps me identify how can I make their lives better and what they value and don't value in a solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JTBDs evolve with customer's maturity and business needs/ goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>it isn't customer's job to know what they want, often they don't know what they want until you slow then</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is a process – it starts, runs and eventually ends</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>people have jobs, things don't</li>
<li>the things that people want to accomplish in their lives don’t change quickly and thus <strong>JTBD are pretty stable</strong></li>
<li>opportunities exist when people show compensatory behavior</li>
<li><strong>favor progress (now and in future) over outcomes and [[Goal]]</strong></li>
<li><strong>progress defines valve, contrast reveals value</strong> and thus products without context have no value
<ul>
<li>e. g. the value of a steak changes based on contex</li>
<li>at kid's bday party versus a fancy restaurant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>solutions for jobs deliver value also between usages of a tool</li>
<li>the value of the system is how it works together as a whole</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phrasing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well phrased JTBD can suit my product as well as my competitor</li>
<li><strong>Frame design challenges by JTBD to persuade teammates and management</strong> to change a product-with that you motivate innovators (i. e. problem solvers) to find solutions to the problem</li>
<li>being able to distill the core JTBD then allows to position value properly</li>
<li>eliminating customer's need to make a tradeoff to beat the competitor</li>
<li>final JTBD should be portable so that everyone in the organization can use it</li>
<li>JTBD has a good balance between concrete and abstract, between high and low levels</li>
<li>3 rules when forming them from <a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done-old/jobs-to-be-done-examples/">here</a>
<ul>
<li>Keep it customer-centric</li>
<li>Focus on the functional (not the emotional)</li>
<li>Think bigger than your product function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it should
<ol>
<li>help work team together</li>
<li>describe &quot;a better me&quot; for the customer</li>
<li>should avoid describing how customers use your product</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>might use emphasis on struggle brings verbs like give me, make me, help me, ... _which reminds us that the success comes from using a solution</li>
<li>TBD wording should name a solution it has replaced</li>
<li><strong>When in doubt if something is a JTBD</strong> – ask &quot;Can I visualize someone doing this?&quot; and&quot; Does this describe an action?&quot; and if you answer&quot; yes&quot;, you are probably describing a solution</li>
<li>Could be framed as <a href="https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27">Job stories</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>identity a struggling point → qualify it → help people imagine how better their life would be with a different solution and help to deliver progress to clients during that proces<br>
![[Pasted image 20241225134219.png]]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scaling</h2>
<ul>
<li>consider splitting products and services based on different JTBD to avoid bulky solutions and losing focus</li>
<li><strong>shift from selling one complicated product into multiple</strong>, that form a cohesive system together e.g. Lean Canvas → Lean Stack</li>
</ul>
<h2>Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>knowing the context of the struggle helps to know how to grow the product</li>
<li>grow your business by delivering progress</li>
</ul>
<h2>[[Opposing forces of customer demand]]</h2>
<h2>[[System of progress]]</h2>
<h2>Promoting TBD in an organization</h2>
<ul>
<li>use these questions to kickstart discussion in a team</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How are customers struggling?</li>
<li>What is pushing their need for a new solution?</li>
<li>Without describing the feature – how would their life will be better once they started using it?</li>
<li>what is preventing customers from using that solution?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>agree on these and then verify in-field</li>
<li>with this we're selling it as a verification of our assumption, not introducing a new framework which should make it easier</li>
</ul>
<h2>JTBD flavors</h2>
<ul>
<li>jobs-as-activities
<ul>
<li>similar to Norman's [[Activity-centered design]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>jobs-as-progress
<ul>
<li>How things are today (actual self) → I need something to make this change (progress) → How I want things to be (desired self)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
