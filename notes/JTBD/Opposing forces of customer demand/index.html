![[Pasted image 20241225133343.png]]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demand generation</h3>
<ul>
<li>push &amp; pull
<ul>
<li>push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>people want to change when they are pushed into discomfort</strong> either internally or externally
<ul>
<li>e. g. having a second child during shopping i. e. the old way of solving their problems need to change – an example of an external push</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel of the motivation
<ul>
<li>there are <strong>two pull types</strong>
<ul>
<li>an idea of a better life or</li>
<li>preference for a particular product</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>push and pull can't live without each other</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demand decrease</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>anxiety &amp; inertia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demand reduction factors are often overlooked – they are just as much a competitor as a competing business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two types of anxiety</p>
<ul>
<li>anticipatory
<ul>
<li>being afraid of a decision</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anticipated
<ul>
<li>being afraid of causes a decision brings</li>
<li>starts after making a decision</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>anxieties are especially important for <strong>first-time customers</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inertia – the tendency to do nothing and remain unchanged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>habits play a crucial role when researching for possible inertia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>i. e. habits in use and habits in choice</li>
<li>e. g. can be tackled by offering an export from a legacy tool to the new one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>old and deeply rooted <strong>habits might prevent one from switching to a competitor</strong> and thus users might start regressing because keeping old habits is easier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if habits are preventing customers hiring you, then solving for those is an easy win</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fight anxiety by helping clients visualize</strong> how their life could be if they choose you and <strong>focus on the impact you bring to their life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>e. g. looking like a great chef &gt; coal grill features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>reduce anxiety in choice with trials, discounts or promotions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify any habits in use that might block customers from buying your product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>comparing the habits of best customers to switchers' is the best way to find out how to make switchers return</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
