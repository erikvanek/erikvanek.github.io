<li>has a zero-sum nature</li>
<li>competition <strong>should not be restricted to products or services that look and work similarly</strong> e. g. iPod was not dismissed because of a better MP3 player but by a mobile app, same with combustion engines and electric cars</li>
<li>in order to beat competing solutions, one must give customers a reason to switch from an existing one or hire anew one</li>
<li>you can claim that something is a competition only after seeing a customer switching between them</li>
<li><strong>if you don't have a clear idea of what your clients are going to give up when they start using your product you haven't done enough research</strong> and you're creating a solution no-one will buy</li>
<li>think of your business as a <em>system of products</em> that perpetuates the [[JTBD#System of progress]]] forward e. g. an iPhone without Appstore is far less valuable</li>
