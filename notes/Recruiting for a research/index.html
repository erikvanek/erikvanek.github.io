<ul>
<li>focus on proper screening before hiring for a research study</li>
<li>when cold calling, include a clear CTA when reaching out
<ul>
<li>screening form</li>
<li>Calendly link to book a time slot directly</li>
<li>it works better to send emails directly to specific people, not to use generic mailboxes like <em>info@entity.domain</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be aware of time friction you can't predict
<ul>
<li>approval rounds, vacations, internal (de)motivation, hesitancy, ...</li>
<li>writing an email won't yield interviewees for your tomorrow's free time slot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iterative / adaptive recruitment
<ul>
<li>start with a small circle / batch of people, then see how they react, possibly adapt your copy and reach out further</li>
<li>you need to balance out the amount of participants you're interested in to those you need to weed out</li>
<li>it takes time and focus if spread way too much</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>realistically consider 5 – 20 % response rate during cold calling, previous exposure increases chances of people responding back</li>
<li>my approach – Kobe Bryant method – You don't score if you don't shoot – if I need to have 10 respondents I need to fire at least 100 mails, maybe more</li>
<li>it is worth using [[Calendly]] for scheduling</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
