<h2>Research planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>includes research loops, sample size &amp; selection &amp; [[Design methods]] selection</li>
<li><em>research loops are a tool to iterate</em></li>
<li>don't forget about [[Triangulation]]</li>
<li>when deciding sample selection - beware of research bias</li>
<li><em>emergent sampling</em>
<ul>
<li>follow new leads during fieldwork as they unfold, leverage flexibly new knowledge</li>
<li>i.e. when you find something interesting, don't ignore it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>beware of research context
<ul>
<li>e.g. when researching train station service
<ul>
<li>what kind of people you need at train station during different day times</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it us useful to engage with participants in their natural surroundings</li>
<li>when more research only confirms already identified patterns, <strong>theoretical saturation</strong> is reached</li>
<li>research types
<ul>
<li>overt
<ul>
<li>you are open with your intent</li>
<li>inherently biased with &quot;the observer effect&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>covert
<ul>
<li>your intent is hidden</li>
<li>ethically problematic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a good method mix combines each of:
<ul>
<li>[[Desk research]]
<ul>
<li>before or in parallel - try to go through some [[Secondary research]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[[Self-ethnographic research]]</li>
<li>[[Participant approach]]
<ul>
<li>interviews, observation, focus groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-participant approaches
<ul>
<li>non-participant observation, cultural probes, co-creating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Co-creative workshops
<ul>
<li>journey maps, system maps, co-creating personas</li>
</ul>
