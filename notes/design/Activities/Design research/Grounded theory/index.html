<ul>
<li>qualitative method that enables to study a particular phenomenon or process and discover new theories that are based on the collection and analysis of real world data</li>
<li><em>grounded theory is an inductive approach where new theories are derived from the data</em>
<ul>
<li>data -&gt; theory -&gt; data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>data collection comes in layers, first scratching the surface, then going deeper</li>
<li>Steps:
<ul>
<li>collecting the data</li>
<li>coding / pattern finding</li>
<li>theoretical campling</li>
<li>estabilishing ona winning theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>useful when spotting emerging trends or predicting beharior</li>
</ul>
<h2>the process</h2>
<ol>
<li>define a data gathering strategy that <strong>leads towards project goals</strong></li>
<li>data collection</li>
<li>[[Coding]] - start with open coding, then continue with [[Selective coding]] after having gone through some [[Axial coding]] based on priorities
<ol>
<li>it's possible to create code hierarchies</li>
<li>Can help to spot emerging trends</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Memos - the tool to document categorization and coding
<ol>
<li>it is useful to track the &quot;why&quot; during this process</li>
<li>new insights can emerge from well defined memos</li>
