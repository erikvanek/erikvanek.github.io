<h2>Customer interviews</h2>
<ul>
<li>the problem with customer interviews is <strong>that they want to please you</strong> therefore can't be trusted fully</li>
<li>What helps is to <strong>ask more widely for their [[JTBD]]</strong> and their context rather than just on a specific product
<ul>
<li>focus on the question – what is the job your customer is hiring you for?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we must <strong>understand what customers do and do not know</strong>
<ul>
<li>customers usually know only what system tells and allows then</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>JTBD interviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>understanding a customer's moment of struggle</strong> can help marketing a solution. It can be even a moment of anxiety that prevents him doing something</li>
<li><strong>look for struggle</strong> and energy to tap into when identifying customer jobs or energy and desire to evolve</li>
<li>after finding the struggle – look for ways how could customers make their lives better</li>
<li>key is to identify <strong>what they struggle with and what is what they aspire for</strong>
<ul>
<li>like a gap analysis it shows where they are at versus where they want to be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>start with mapping out demand generators, then blockers</strong>
<ul>
<li>pushes and pulls, then anxiety and inertia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During interviews rephrase <em>What job does my product do?”</em> into <strong>“What job is the customer trying to get done when using the product?”</strong></li>
<li>ideal targets are customers who recently bought your product or a similar product from a competitor</li>
<li>when interviewing customers – they will always offer a solution about a problem they're facing. Leave the solution to them and separate the problem from the solution.</li>
<li>**The most critical during interviewing is to understand what causes someone to buy something</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ask about</h3>
<ul>
<li>what they've done, not what they want</li>
<li>what other solutions they tried</li>
<li>what worked and what did not</li>
<li>what is similar and what is different between those solutions</li>
<li>how is their life better once they have solved the [[JTBD]]</li>
<li>what makes customers think one solution is better than the other</li>
<li>How will the customers evolve once their job is solved</li>
<li>what alternatives have you tours tried before</li>
<li>at what point they realized current solution was not working anymore</li>
<li>identity pulls by asking opinions on other products, why did they choose them and how do they compare to each other</li>
<li>if there is something that blocks you from buying my product
<ul>
<li>if so, what might help to mitigate?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what budget you're taking away from and how it is managed</li>
<li>why have leaving clients stopped using your product</li>
<li>if struggling now, why not last week/month/ year... and what has changed?</li>
<li>why not choosing other solution? how do they compare to each other?</li>
<li>what value does current competition deliver?</li>
<li>once they achieve the new me
<ul>
<li>how does it feel?</li>
<li>Did it bring expected outcomes?</li>
<li>Did it bring some new aspirations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concrete Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>How did you try to solve this before?</li>
<li>What would your like be like when your job gets done?</li>
</ul>
