<ul>
<li>also called The cone of plausibility</li>
<li>created by Joseph Voros to navigate uncertainty &amp; embrace possibility</li>
<li>categorizing future scenarios into four buckets
<ul>
<li>Probable futures
<ul>
<li>this is where design usually operates</li>
<li>what is likely to happen</li>
<li>very present-oriented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible futures
<ul>
<li>what could happen, even if it's difficult to imagine</li>
<li>uses fiction as a reflection tool</li>
<li>needs a believable series of events that connect even the most extreme situations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plausible futures
<ul>
<li>refers to what could happen</li>
<li>space about exploration, not prediction</li>
<li>the filter for putting a scenario in this cone is whether various possible futures, including macro forces such as the economy or geopolitics, might allow a business to continue to survive and thrive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preferred futures
<ul>
<li>where you place the scenarios you want to happen</li>
<li>not the answer but where most strategic debates happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
