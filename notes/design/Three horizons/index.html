<li>useful conceptual model to aid people thinking about current assumptions, emerging changes and possible &amp; desired futures</li>
<li>helps to think about potential changes in short/mid/long term and what impacts those might bring</li>
<li>helps to generate innovation by challenging assumptions from different perspectives</li>
<li>Horizons:
<ul>
<li>First
<ul>
<li>current context &amp; conditions</li>
<li>the focus is on maintaining stability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third
<ul>
<li>transformative emerging changes, thoughts about possible futures and visions of preferred futures</li>
<li>the focus is on transformation and disruption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second
<ul>
<li>actions taken in the present to resist change, or to adapt to it or build on top of it</li>
<li>the focus is on creating and managing change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>large room with one blank wall for a long wall mural
<ul>
<li>used for drawing three overlapping curves depicting the three horizons</li>
<li>wall should be long enough so that it's comfy for participants to play with post-its around</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ideally having 3 colors of post-its for each horizon</li>
</ul>
<h2>The process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask participants to work in pairs and each pair gets some pens &amp; post-its
<ul>
<li>Horizon 1
<ul>
<li>20-30 mins</li>
<li>Ask pairs to brainstorm as many answers to questions:
<ul>
<li>&quot;What are current working assumptions about product, service, resource, staffu, customers&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What is the current state of play?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What are managers taking for granted when making decisions?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 mins brainstorming, then posting to the mural</li>
<li>15 mins clustering, discussing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Horizon 3
<ul>
<li>45 mins</li>
<li>identification of emerging trends representing transformational shifts from the present</li>
<li>Ask questions like:
<ul>
<li>&quot;What changes are emerging as new paradigms?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What new inventions has you worried or excited?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What are visionary leaders saying?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 mins pair brainstorming
<ul>
<li>it is expected to have fewer ideas generated as talking about the future is not easy
<ul>
<li>a deck of 'change cards' can be useful to kickstart the ideation</li>
<li>those can be also then used by teams to post on mural</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 mins reviewing the change deck cards, clustering &amp; posting on the mural</li>
<li>15 mins to review all the changes posted on the mural</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Horizon 2
<ul>
<li>45 mins</li>
<li>divide people into 4-6 sized tables</li>
<li>review assumptions from Horizon 1 &amp; emerging issues from Horizon 3</li>
<li>the main question of this horizon is &quot;What assumptions are challenged by those changes, and how can we respond to the resulting opportunities and risks?&quot;, i.e. more focused:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Which assumptions will be most challenged by change?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Which are most vulnerable to these emerging changes?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Are there any which are being strengthened?&quot; Pick one highly vulnerable assumption.</li>
<li>&quot;How can you use the emerging changes to create entirely new products, services and markets?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Is there another business model that could replace a challenged model? Other production process(es)? New sources in the supply chain? Emerging customer segments?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose two to three emerging changes that could be used to build new models or processes</li>
<li>Each group use an interesting transition idea to successfully bridge from Horizon 1 to Horizon 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debrief
<ul>
<li>15 mins</li>
<li>discussing key hightlights from the exercise</li>
<li>What current assumptions will be most challenged by change?</li>
<li>Will any become obsolete in the face of the changes weâ€™ve identified?</li>
<li>What changes offer the most promise and immediately actionable opportunities</li>
<li>Which innovations or initiatives hold the most promise?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
