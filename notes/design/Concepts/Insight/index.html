<li>writing insight well is not an easy task</li>
<li><em>is a non-obvious observation grounded in data that explains the &quot;why&quot; behind consumer motivations and human behavior</em></li>
<li><em>the goal of every insight statement is to help stakeholders understand users' emotional experiences and inspire well-defined product ideation</em></li>
<li>Data refers to unanalyzed user observations, findings capture patterns among data points, and <em>insights are the actionable opportunities based on research and business goals.</em></li>
<li>one of the most important steps to creating an effective insight statement is knowing the information required</li>
<li>Well-structured insight consists is:
<ul>
<li>based on actual facts and data and not mere opinions</li>
<li>inspiring ideas</li>
<li>helping to understand users' mental models</li>
<li>written in clear, simple, and precise language</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>findings are not enough as they don't provide context</li>
<li>user insights typically focus on the user's <strong>unmet needs</strong>, <strong>underlying motivations</strong>, and <strong>surprising behaviors</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insight anatomy</h2>
<p><strong>“I saw this” + “I know this” = insight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“I saw this”</strong> - user research data gathered through research, ideally from various sources</li>
<li><strong>“I know this”</strong> - accumulated life experience, worldview, and meaning for the insight creator(s)</li>
<li><strong>Insight</strong> - deep, meaningful, and contextual perception</li>
</ul>
<h2>Communicating insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be Evidence-Based</li>
<li>Be Visual</li>
<li>Quantify findings. For example, instead of saying more users enjoy browsing on their smartphones, say, &quot;6 out of 10 users enjoy browsing on their mobile phones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structuring insights</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are your findings
<ul>
<li>This is where the most valuable data from finding is stored</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are they happening
<ul>
<li>Articulating the root cause(s) of the discovery</li>
<li>You can also draw inferences like educated guesses or hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the evidence</li>
<li>What can be done about them</li>
</ol>
