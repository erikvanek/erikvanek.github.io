<li>is the bare bone of [[Design research]]</li>
<li>when developing research questions - think ahead of what will happen to answers - we receive since I know what comes next in the process after I have concluded it
<ul>
<li>i.e. don't do research just for the sake of doing research, think of how gathered [[Insight]]s help us to move forward in the next phase</li>
<li>ask a question <strong>&quot;How will the answer to this question help to generate a range of insights &amp; ideas to create a new value?&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[[Research question]] is often vague at the beginning but it <em>gets precised</em> over time</li>
<li>helpful to come up with more to start with and then conclude with one</li>
</ul>
