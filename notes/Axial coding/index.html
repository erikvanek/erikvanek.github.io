<ul>
<li>before doing axial coding you should have a set of open codes, that have seemingly little to do with each other
<ul>
<li>they might be very discrete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>the process of identifying larger themes relevant to your research question</em></li>
<li>those themes define the 'axes' around which the codes can be organized</li>
<li>axial code represents a potentially key theme that might be significant to your data analysis and theory generation</li>
</ul>
