    <h1>Piloting a new childcare service</h1>

    <section class="perex">
        <div>
            <p>In collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs, we are developing a new childcare service inspired
                by the "Tagesmutter" model in Germany. Our goal is to create a nurturing alternative that provides care
                in the welcoming homes of caregivers. By offering small-group settings, we prioritize personal attention
                and foster a family-like atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>We are committed to understanding and meeting the needs of children and families. We actively listen to
                their feedback, using it to shape our service. By collaborating with our stakeholders, we ensure that
                our childcare service remains responsive and impactful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside this project, we are dedicated to enhancing the design maturity of the organization. By
                fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and customer-centricity, we aim to create a meaningful
                impact. Through our work, we strive to empower the Ministry of Social Affairs to embrace innovative,
                human-centered design approaches and techniques.

        <h3>Project goals</h3>

        <h4>Understanding user and stakeholder needs</h4>
        <p>Through user research, we gain insights into the needs, motivations, and barriers of primary user groups and
            key
            stakeholders. This understanding helps us position the service effectively and sets clear boundaries for
            designing
            processes and tools.</p>

        <h4>Stakeholder alignment</h4>
        <p>Designing a public service involves aligning multiple stakeholders with different motivations, fears, and
            expectations. We work towards understanding each perspective to move the project forward effectively.</p>

        <h4>Service prototyping</h4>
        <p>We embrace an iterative, feedback-driven approach throughout the project. Storyboarding helps us empathize
            with user
            needs and identify process improvements. We test various artifacts <a
                href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/rite/" target="_blank">rapidly</a> to
            ensure
            they are delivered in the best possible way.</p>

        <h4>Human-centered design advocacy</h4>
        <p>
            By observing and understanding the challenges faced by project teams in bringing human-centered designs, we
            gather
            valuable insights for the organization. We document, share, and find ways to improve conditions for future
            innovation initiatives.

        <h3>Key outcomes</h3>
        <h4>Developing the pilot structure</h4>
        <p>We designed and delivered a comprehensive pilot project structure, providing valuable content and guidance
            throughout its course. By facilitating key events and ensuring smooth execution, we successfully led the
            initiative from conception to completion.</p>

</figure>

        <h4>Fostering remote collaboration</h4>
        <p>Despite the ministry's focus on in-person interactions, we created an efficient remote collaboration
            environment. Our ability to adapt and deliver successful outcomes, even in challenging circumstances,
            highlights our flexibility and problem-solving skills.</p>
        <h4>Promoting public participation</h4>
        <p>Through our facilitation of several round table and focus group sessions, we effectively included key
            stakeholders in the project. This inclusive approach garnered valuable insights and demonstrated our
            commitment to stakeholder engagement and public participation.</p>
        <h4>Building key partnerships</h4>
        <p>We prioritized establishing close contacts with key stakeholders, such as the ministry deputy, recognizing
            that top-level support is crucial for project success. By fostering collaboration with these influential
            actors, we were able to define and pursue critical project priorities.</p>
        <h4>Implementing iterative processes</h4>
        <p>Our team introduced an iterative approach to key activities, enabling faster feedback loops than typically
            experienced in the ministry environment. By inviting broader public collaboration, we showcased our ability
            to co-design public policies in a participative manner, leaving a positive impact and setting a new standard
            for engagement.</p>
