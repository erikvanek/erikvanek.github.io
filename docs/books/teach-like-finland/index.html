<p>Finland is world known for its well performing school system at least based on PISA scores. Is it really the case? Timothy D. Walker brings a comparison of his experience with american and finish school systems and provides 33 things which schools in Northern American can learn from schools in Finland.<br>
I am positively surprised about how 'easy' those things to change can be. Be it a simple fresh air in classes, 15 minute breaks every hour (spent ideally outside, even when it's raining there). All these small things are backed by some research therefore combined together, they bring a great cocktail resulting in happier students, teachers, parents and maybe whole society?<br>
It feels like any of those strategies that author provides are not difficult to achieve per se. But maybe a mindset shift in more conservative educational facilities might be the tougher part of the change. Maybe a change is not needed at all...</p>
