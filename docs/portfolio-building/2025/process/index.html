<h1 id="how-does-my-process-look-like">How does my process look like</h1>
<p>I focus on two key components when working with clients – finding and shaping <strong>the right challenge to invest time into</strong> and <strong>finding the right solution(s) to that problem</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="shaping-challenges">Shaping challenges</h1>
<p>Our culture is focused on problem solving. But when we're trying to solve the wrong problem, we might easily waste resources like time, well-being or money. By focusing on <strong>findihg the right problem to solve</strong>, we tackle this risk and save resources in the long run.</p>
<p>What we might do together?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>find patterns and trends</strong> in what you already know – my clients are usually experts in their fields and thus know the context of their domains pretty well</li>
<li>conduct a <strong>deep dive</strong> research into existing research reports, trends in your field or best practices among your competitors or field leaders</li>
<li>we'll probably <strong>define research plan and objectives</strong> to find out more about the problem if we realize that we don't know about it enough (which happens most of the time)</li>
<li>we'll <strong>frame and reframe</strong> the problem we want to tackle continuously until we're happy with its shape and scope based on our continuous learning</li>
</ul>
