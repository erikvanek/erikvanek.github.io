<h1 id="piloting-a-new-childcare-service">Piloting a new childcare service ðŸ‘¶</h1>
<p>A collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs to develop SousedskÃ© dÄ›tskÃ© skupiny - a <strong>personalized, home-based childcare service that puts children's needs first</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>The Ministry wanted to develop a new childcare service that would provide nurturing, home-like environments for children. The key was <strong>designing a service that would prioritize children's needs while working within regulatory frameworks</strong> and complex stakeholder relationships and needs.</p>
<h2 id="data-driven-decisions">Data-driven decisions</h2>
<p>Together with a fellow designer and a research expert, we managed to identify <strong>crucial insights through ethnographic</strong> research into children's and caregivers' daily experiences to guide further development.</p>
<p>This understanding allowed us to make informed decisions later on in the process and also helped us to focus on most important aspects of the service like onboarding process and support materials for service clients.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-project-development">Pilot project development</h2>
<p>After gathering enough data and identifying serviceâ€™s possible pain points, I was shaping and facilitating the pilot program with a fellow designer. Main <strong>aim of the program was to bring useful data for upcoming legislation changes by simulating the childcare</strong> within regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The program itself was consisting of three main pillars. First part was focusing on running an internal incubation program for promising service clients. The second one was aimed at prototyping and development of onboarding materials. Third one was aimed at enhancing our research data.</p>
<p>Another imporant aspect was building trust and maintaining clear communication between stakeholders and our team. That is especially valuable in the public sector environment, where change typically moves at a measured pace.</p>
<h2 id="personal-learnings">Personal learnings ðŸ’¡</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Innovating in the public sector taught me that meaningful change is possible, just at a different rhythm than in tech startups.</p>
<p>Learning when to push for quick wins and when to invest time in building trust and alignment turned out to be a valuable lesson. If you're facing similar challenges in your organization, I'd love to hear about them.</p>
