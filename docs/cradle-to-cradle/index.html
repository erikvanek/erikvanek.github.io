<li><strong>right now (2002) we're losing 5000x more soil than it's being developed</strong></li>
<li>after post-WWII throwaway products became a norm</li>
<li>&quot;What if we could design a system that safely captured the phosphate already in circulation (excrements) rather than discarding it as a sludge?&quot;</li>
<li>with materials it makes sense to celebrate the sameness and commonality rather than trying/needing to have the unique one</li>
<li>if people are to thrive they need to imitate nature's nutrient flow and metabolism, in which the very concept of waste does not exist</li>
<li>a concept of &quot;product of service&quot; similar to X as a service
<ul>
<li>e.g. returning a TV after 10 000 viewing hours would allow the provider to upcycle the item after its expected lifespan</li>
<li>e.g. rent a solvent - degreasing service for companies would allow for higher quality degreasing instead of buying abundant cheap solvents</li>

<li>sewage + ponds + diverse algae + fish -&gt; C2C system for water purification</li>
<li>fossiel fuels as a brute force energy supply</li>
<li>industrial revolution gave people amazing power over nature</li>
<li>decentralized smaller power supplies (e.g. small shared solars) are more <strong>resilient</strong> compared to largescale (e.g. nuclear)</li>
<li>packaging can be enriched with seeds of plants that once thrown away can sproot in nature creating some sort of seed bomb to enrich local ecosystem</li>
<li>__Question: &quot;What kind of world do we intend, and how might we design things in keeping with that vision?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;lotus effect&quot; - nothing sticks to a lotus leaf, is that something to inspire from when making clothes?</li>
<li>design challenge: <strong>What kind of soap does the river want?</strong></li>
<li><strong>16% of former USSR uninhabitable due to ecocide</strong></li>
<li>tripple bottom line - &quot;Ecology, equity and economy&quot;
<ul>
<li>usually focuses on economy and the rest is more of an afterthought</li>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>One of the most important books I have read so far. I would call it the bible of upcycling but that would reduce its value and impact.</p>
<p>For me it serves a good predecessor of transition design in a way that it does not leave the planetery and ecological aspect of designing behind. It rather puts it at the core of our thinking and as one of the highest priorities when working on new products. Also its concept of &quot;product of service&quot; seems to be one of the predecessors of <em>whatever</em> as a service that is being coined around a lot around lately.</p>
<p>Probably the most important aspect of the book is the focus on upcycling that really opened my eyes regarding how one can think about that. When we consider upcycling only as an afterthought we'll never get the most of the product we want to upcycle. What happens with a product after it has finished its primary journey needs to be embedded in its initial design. Only this way it can be then reused meaningfully and in the best case in a way, that does not decrease its value in contrast to downcycling.</p>
