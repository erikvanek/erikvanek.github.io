      <article><p>❤️ grattitude alert ❤️</p>
<p>I've embarked on probably one of the most interesting journeys so far recently<br>
Eying design since ever but never felt like switching from a comfy engineering chair<br>
Being part of infarm layoff rounds felt like a great opportunity to fully jump on a new challenge<br>
Since then I make my living as a freelance designer and facilitator in various fields like public services, NGOs and or also for private clients<br>
What's great is I can hone different skills in different environments - hacking together a small app or a website, consulting a database restructuring in a NGO or public sphere is quite often somehow rare and valuable skill<br>
On the other hand - technological companies often lack the 'soft' aspect of things when talking to their partners like users, clients or suppliers. I often bridge gaps between departments. Also I can bridge efficiently between design and engineering.<br>
I'm not big on celebrations but in recent months I had a chance to work on a project that recently got awarded as a most innovative public service effort in Czechia in 2024. I've researched how innovative teams in czech public services work and how they difer to 'standard teams'. I've organized a follow-up co-creation workshop with several ministry secretaries and HR managers focused on baby-stepping innovations in their offices. After tutoring a class in last spring semester, I've led a whole class of students in Service design workshop class at MUNI.</p>
<p>All of this would not be possible without so many incredible people I've met in last two or three years. I don't want to name specifically as it's hard to draw the line who to name and who to not. Some of you are profficient linkediners, some of those unicorns as I call them are not even present here. It can be project colleagues, research participants, class mates (yep I study again). Some of those people I often refer to might be interested how much they influenced me by their presence.</p>
<p>I don't mean this to brag. Linkedin feels a bit too cliche. But hey - who cares? Thanks to all great people around. I learned to show grattitude in last years. So at least some of you know who I mean by this. And if you've read so far and we're in touch in last two three years – there's a high chance you're of them. And if not - that's OK. People come and go. I love when more good people come than go. And I hope it stays like this for quite some time.</p>
<p>One emotional one - returning to my hometown Zlín (feel free to ask me why I call it Evilville) for a panel discussion during ZDW. Also you can find me workshoppin' at FKB in late June. And meanwhile I'll try to earn some buck as quite a high percentage of those 'interesting' endavours is unpaid or poorly paid labor. Sad but true.</p>
<p>Cheers ❤️</p>
