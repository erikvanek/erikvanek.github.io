<h1 id="snap">Snap</h1>
<p>Snap helps you to take notes while your hands are busy. Like when you're cleaning windows, making pesto or you're simply jogging.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You connect Snap with your Spotify account</li>
<li>once connected, you can turn Snap's listening feature</li>
<li>once listening, everytime you say 'Snap', you can record a note which is automatically transcripted to text</li>
<li>if you say 'Snap' again, Snap automatically resumes the podcast</li>
<li>if you say 'Rewind' it rewinds the podcast 30 seconds</li>
<li>at the end of the session, you can easily export notes in a standalone markdown file</li>
</ul>
