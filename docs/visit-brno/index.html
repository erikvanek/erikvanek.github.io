<p>Why? Because it's dope &amp; fun ðŸ˜Š</p>
<h2>Main attractions</h2>
<p>If you're up for visiting churches, cathedrals or a castle - there's a plethora of guides on the internetz to help you. What Brno does best though is its unique and affordable gastronomy. There's a Brno's mythical tripod - coffe, cake &amp; beer. You can find many places where you can actually get all of these in a great quality at once like Jaga (formerly called Atlas), Sesta vetev or Podnebi.<br>
Let me suggest you my favourite places around town and why they're so good. I'll just limit each category to three places so that it's not overwhelming.</p>
