<ul>
<li>is the bare bone of [[Design research]]</li>
<li>when developing research questions - think ahead of what will happen to answers - we receive since I know what comes next in the process after I have concluded it
<ul>
<li>i.e. don't do research just for the sake of doing research, think of how gathered [[Insight]]s help us to move forward in the next phase</li>
<li>ask a question <strong>&quot;How will the answer to this question help to generate a range of insights &amp; ideas to create a new value?&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[[Research question]] is often vague at the beginning but it <em>gets precised</em> over time</li>
<li>helpful to come up with more to start with and then conclude with one</li>
<li>should start with <em>&quot;How&quot;</em></li>
<li>clear, focused, and concise statement that conveys the objectives of the research and its potential findings</li>

<li>A good research question is specific, actionable, and practical:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to answer the question using the techniques and methods available to you</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It’s possible (but not guaranteed) that you can arrive at an answer with a sufficient degree of confidence to base decisions on what you’ve learned</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dive deep into ]framing research questions</li>
<li><strong>Only <em>after</em> you have identified your research questions can you select the best way to answer the question.</strong>
<ul>
<li>first research question, then research plan and activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research X Interview question
<ul>
<li>RQ - <strong>How do families with school-age children decide how to spend money on vacations?</strong></li>
<li>IQ - <strong>Walk me through your last vacation from planning it until when you arrived back home.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>4 main categories:
<ul>
<li>Generative/Exploratory: How will this activity yield the kind of deep understanding we seek?</li>
<li>Descriptive: How will this activity provide a detailed, truthful, and accurate picture of the situation or sequence of events?
<ul>
<li>Evaluative: How will this activity enable a reliable assessment based on a clear set of criteria?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Causal: How will this activity establish a cause and effect relationship, beyond simple correlation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 main characteristics:
<ul>
<li><strong>Feasible.</strong> You need to have the resources and abilities to examine the question, collect the data, and give answers.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting.</strong> Create research questions that offer fascinating insights into your industry.</li>
<li><strong>Novel.</strong> Research questions have to offer something new within your field of study.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical.</strong> The research question topic should be approved by the relevant authorities and review boards.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant.</strong> Your research question should lead to visible changes in society or your industry.<br>
7 types of quali research questions:</li>
<li><a href="https://dovetail.com/research/explanatory-research/">Explanatory research</a> questions investigate particular topic areas that aren't well known.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual</strong> research questions describe the workings of what is already in existence.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluative</strong> research questions examine the effectiveness of specific paradigms or methods.</li>
<li><strong>Ideological</strong> research questions aim to advance existing ideologies.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptive</strong> research questions describe an event.</li>
<li><a href="https://dovetail.com/ux/generative-research/">Generative research</a> questions help develop actions and theories by providing new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Emancipatory</strong> research questions increase social action engagement, usually to benefit disadvantaged people.</li>
