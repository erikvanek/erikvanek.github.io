<li><strong>to understand people &amp; their behavior related to the product or service</strong></li>
<li>enables to <em>empathize</em> &amp; get to know the context</li>
<li>is <em>&quot;Becoming friends with reality&quot;</em> - Erika Hall</li>
<li>motivation to find out how customers or other relevant actors experience a given service</li>
<li>helps to move beyond assumptions</li>
<li>two main types:
<ul>
<li>qualitative
<ul>
<li>answers the question &quot;Why?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>quantitative
<ul>
<li>answers the question &quot;How?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>starts with a [[Research question]] and aims to derive [[Insight]]s</strong></li>
<li>usually is based on ethnographic methods</li>
<li>typical process:
<ul>
<li>research scope &amp; planning -&gt; data collection -&gt; synthesis -&gt; key [[Insight]]s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>gives us:
<ul>
<li>customer problems &amp; needs</li>
<li>experience gaps</li>
<li>testing &amp; feedback collection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>outcomes should be <em>clear &amp; understandable to the whole team</em></li>
<li>use [[Triangulation]] - allows to have more &amp; better [[Prototype]]s</li>
<li>starts with [[Research planning]]</li>
<li>results should be visualized by [[Research Visualization]]</li>
<li>&quot;CX oriented research is rather inductive (finding out along the way), whereas testing prototypes is deductive (validating hypothesis)&quot;</li>
<li>Important to take notes [well][<a href="https://condens.io/user-research-note-taking/">https://condens.io/user-research-note-taking/</a>]</li>
<li><strong>The mismatches between user attitudes and user actions are often a great source of insights</strong>.</li>
<li>Two main fidelities
<ul>
<li>pure - rigorous research uncovering completely new knowledge</li>
<li>applied - less rigorous, borrows ideas and techniques from pure research but is more relaxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research can be also looked through the <a href="https://dovetail.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right/">double diamond</a> paradigm</li>
