<h3 id="its-far-past-time-to-control-the-algorithm">It's Far Past Time to Control the Algorithm</h3>
<p>UX Collective argues that algorithmic feeds should fall under user experience responsibility. &quot;To be as blunt as possible: algorithmic feeds should fall under user experience. This is because I, perhaps naively, still believe in the mission of user experience serving users. Their wellbeing should be the true chief concern, which means operating in a transparent and ethical way.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="harsh-truths-for-designers-the-end-of-ux">Harsh Truths for Designers: The End of UX?</h3>
<p>Mig Reyes, VP of Product Experience at Duolingo (formerly at Instagram), shares uncomfortable truths about the design industry. &quot;This is an uncomfortable thing to say in the industry but I do think UX design is an archaic term,&quot; says Reyes, explaining why Duolingo changed from &quot;UX&quot; to &quot;Product Experience&quot; and why visual design excellence matters more than ever.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-cursor-300m-arr-ai-tool-reshaping-software-engineering">The Rise of Cursor: $300M ARR AI Tool Reshaping Software Engineering</h3>
<p>Cursor, the AI code editor, has reached $300M in annual recurring revenue just two years after launch. CEO Michael Truell discusses their evolution from a CAD tool to a coding platform, explaining how future programming will shift toward natural language and &quot;taste&quot; as a core engineering skill. Cursor's custom AI models have created a competitive edge in the rapidly growing market.</p>

<h3 id="cheating-at-your-job-with-ai">Cheating at Your Job with AI</h3>
<p>Cassie Kozyrkov argues that using AI tools to increase productivity isn't cheating—it's working smarter. &quot;Unless your job is to manually do a task, your job is to get an outcome. Your company doesn't care how you got there, as long as it's legal, ethical, and delivers quality results,&quot; she writes, providing practical examples of how AI can enhance decision-making.</p>

<h3 id="benedict-evans-on-ai-in-retail-and-advertising">Benedict Evans on AI in Retail and Advertising</h3>
<p>Benedict Evans examines how major platforms are pivoting toward AI-enhanced retail and advertising. &quot;The global ad industry is about a trillion dollars, and roughly half of that goes to Google, Meta, and Amazon. That's very tempting if you're a model-builder with Nvidia bills to pay and a technology that looks like it could tell people what to buy in an entirely new way,&quot; he writes, analyzing how OpenAI, Meta, and others are approaching this opportunity.</p>
