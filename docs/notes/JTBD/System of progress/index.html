<ul>
<li>interdependence defines a system i. e. parts influence each other</li>
<li>a triad between customers, their JTBD and producers</li>
<li><strong>4 main parts</strong>
<ul>
<li>the customer imagines a better life situation (new me)</li>
<li>the customer searches for and picks a solution</li>
<li>the customer uses a solution to mate progress</li>
<li>the customer realizes a new me</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>innovator's responsibility is to identify why, how and when [[Customer]]s realized they need to change</li>
<li>in <em>looking for solutions</em> phase is the moment for gathering highest volume of data for customers' JTBD because <em>[[Customer]]s already have a picture of new me in their minds</em> and are trying to figure out how to get there</li>
<li>goal in this phase is to <em>figure out why are customers looking (and then buying) for a solution and were not a month ago</em>, how did they find a solution and what were their hiring criteria and why didn't choose some other solution</li>
<li>when customers start using a solution, <strong>we must know what they value over competition</strong> so that we can deliver it to them</li>
<li>when people use your solution – track how (well) are they using it</li>
<li>typical cycle: survive → stabilize → mature → scale</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>similar to PDSA – plan, do, study, act model but it is more circular</li>
<li><strong>needs, wants and desired outcomes change when a system changes</strong> and interdependent system change in various ways easily</li>
</ul>
