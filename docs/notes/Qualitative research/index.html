<li><em>small-n</em> research</li>
<li>it is <em>not</em> statistically significant</li>
<li>we can't generalize from small sample sizes, it is <em>just different</em> than quantitative research
<ul>
<li>it is a complement to qualitative research</li>
<li>the goal isn't to disprove hypothesis, we're looking to understand the problem in detail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>helps to understand 'the why' behind the problem and its possible root causes</em>, qualitative research would only allow us to speculate</li>
<li>the goal is to gather insights to make informed decisions later</li>
<li>by quantification in our analysis we're opening ourselves up to a quantitative judgement

<h2>[[Rules of qualitative rigor|Rules for qualitative rigor]]</h2>
<ol>
<li>Credibility - confidence in the 'truth' of the findings</li>
<li>Transferability - showing that the findings have applicablity in other contexts</li>
<li>Dependability -Â showing that the findings are consistent and could be repeated</li>
<li>Confirmability - a degree of neutraility or the extent to which the findings of a study are shaped by the respondents and not researcher bias, motivation, or interest.</li>
</ol>

<li>done by Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba</li>
<li>we can satisfy those by being <em>systematic</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Systematic qualitative research</h2>
<ul>
<li>formulates a specific <em>research question before research</em> is conducted</li>
<li>samples carefully by recruiting participants to help to deeply understand the subject matter</li>
<li>facilitates research sessions with <em>open-ended prompts</em></li>
<li>does not take only opinions but <em>tries to understand 'the why'</em> behind them</li>
<li><em>analyzes the data continuously</em> by coding and concluding from the data</li>
<li><strong>attempts to triangulate</strong> when facing something extraordinary or unusual to ensure that our conclusions are supported by data</li>
<li>says what the problem is, quantitative says how bad it is</li>
<li>helps to build an empathetic understanding of our users</li>
</ul>
