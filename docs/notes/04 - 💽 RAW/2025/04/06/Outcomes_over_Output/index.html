    <h1 id="outcomes-over-output">Outcomes Over Output</h1>
<h2 id="ai-assisted-summary">AI-assisted summary</h2>
<p>&quot;Outcomes Over Output&quot; introduces a transformative product development paradigm centered on changing user behaviors (outcomes) that drive business results rather than simply delivering features (outputs). The framework redefines success by focusing on three key questions: identifying which user actions drive business value, determining how to encourage more of these actions, and establishing validation methods to measure effectiveness, creating a continuous learning cycle of building experiments, measuring outcomes, and iterating.</p>
<p>Implementing this approach requires fundamental organizational shifts, as most companies are structured around creating outputs rather than delivering outcomes. The method utilizes outcome-based roadmaps built around customer journey maps and behavior analysis rather than feature timelines. This shift creates more realistic planning around uncertainty while requiring teams to develop explicit theories connecting customer value to business results. Though challenging to adopt due to outcomes' abstract nature and the required surrender of control, the approach ultimately delivers maximum business impact with minimal feature development through deeper understanding of behavior drivers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results</li>
<li>Outcomes are delivered by changing customer behavior</li>
<li>Don't mistake making features for being done, which is a legacy from industrial age</li>
<li>Ideally you want to achieve an outcome by delivering as few features as possible</li>
<li>Program-logic-model: activities ‚Üí outputs ‚Üí outcome ‚Üí impact</li>
<li>Managing impact is too abstract; managing outputs might not yield outcome</li>
<li>We want to manage with outcomes - to ensure that we're driving towards changing customer behavior that brings business results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcomes-vs-outputs">Outcomes vs. Outputs</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What is the customer behavior change we are looking for?&quot;</li>
<li>When working with outcomes, we need a companion tool - an experiment</li>
<li>Power combo: outcome-based approach combined with experiments</li>
<li>E.g. instead of building a well - try out hoses from a river</li>
<li>MVP is an example of an experiment</li>
<li>Outcomes (behavior change) ‚Üí impact (increase in revenue, loyalty...) is a side effect</li>
<li>Designing for outcomes, when done well, yields impact</li>
<li>To figure out what desired outcomes (i.e. customer actions that drive business value), we must understand what customers are doing that drives the results we care about</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-outcome-based-thinking">Implementing Outcome-Based Thinking</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we state goals with outcomes, we propose some relationship between our work and its results which we can then capture in a hypothesis and test with an experiment</li>
<li>3 magic questions:
<ol>
<li>What are the user and customer actions that drive business results?</li>
<li>How can we make people do more of these actions?</li>
<li>How do we know that we're right?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Leaders think about impact, executors are responsible for outputs and outcome</li>
<li>The key is to communicate in desired outcomes and the impact we wish to bring with them</li>
<li>E.g. impact (reduce cost) ‚Üí outcome (fewer people calling tech support) ‚Üí output (improved usability of confusing features)</li>
<li>By having well-defined outcomes, it's easier to track progress</li>
<li>Great starting question: &quot;What customer/user/employee behaviors has this initiative created that drives business results?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcome-based-planning">Outcome-Based Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Outcome-based planning is centered around outcome-based roadmap</li>
<li>Be honest about what you know and don't know and fill in what you don't know by gathering appropriate data</li>
<li>Roadmaps are supposed to help organizations manage uncertainty - the problem is that they are focused mostly on assumptions and fiction</li>
<li>Metaphor: planning crossing a desert of an unknown size - filled with unknowns, uncertainty and unknowables</li>
<li>Promising a roadmap with certainty is really hard to do when we center around outputs - we're promising a certain feature by a certain date</li>
<li>Plan in terms of outcomes and center roadmap around sets of outcomes</li>
<li>To do that we must identify a set or a system of outcomes that taken together will create the result you want</li>
<li>One way to visualize this is to use customer journey maps because it helps to visualize behavior (and behavior relates to outcomes)</li>
<li>After visualizing - ask &quot;what behaviors at each step predict failure/success&quot; ‚Üí this helps us to define boosters/blockers</li>
<li>With this approach - the roadmap is more oriented at questions/hypothesis and filling in blanks/eliminating dead ends</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organizational-adoption-challenges">Organizational Adoption Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Biggest obstacle for adopting outcomes over outputs is that organizations are often organized around making stuff</li>
<li>&quot;How could a manager of an iOS team work on an initiative of re-engaging customers?&quot;</li>
<li>Item detail page - crucial for any e-commerce business: instead of &quot;IDP redesign&quot;, reframe as &quot;boost sales by 10% from IDP&quot;</li>
<li>Instead of talking about a feature set, shift to a desired outcome (impact) an initiative brings</li>
<li>In outcome-based work, teams need to be clear about the value they are trying to create - they need to know the outcome they deliver to clients/users and to the organization</li>
<li>You need to have a theory that if you create a certain impact for the customer, it will yield a certain outcome for the business</li>
<li>E.g. &quot;if we decrease the bounce rate, the users will complete the checkout at a higher rate&quot;</li>
<li>Problem with output-driven teams is that they give an illusion of control because often they work with fixed feature sets and deadlines</li>
<li>Finished feature ‚â† value delivery</li>
<li>Instead of focusing on lists of features, we should aim on managing a list of hypotheses with expected metrics connected to them and continuous evaluation</li>
<li>Trust is a key ingredient for success in adopting outcome-oriented approach</li>
<li>A basic problem of output-based planning is not knowing what value each feature brings, thus it is hard to prioritize</li>
<li>Outcome = problem focused, output = solution focused</li>
<li>Outcomes are hard to think about as they are abstract, features are more concrete</li>
<li>It's a big fundamental shift and giving up control - people figuring out what to do are no longer people owning the results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organizational-implementation">Organizational Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Outcome-based thinking on organizational level has three pillars:
<ol>
<li>Your colleagues are your customers - this mindset allows to bridge silos and gaps especially in large organizations</li>
<li>Everything is an outcome</li>
<li>Everything is an experiment</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When thinking about metrics, use framing: &quot;if we were successful with this initiative, what would be different about customer's behavior?&quot;</li>
<li>When you use outcomes to build your plans, you make progress by running experiments</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-outcomes-learning-cycle">The Outcomes Learning Cycle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build experiments</li>
<li>Measure outcomes</li>
<li>Learn and iterate</li>
