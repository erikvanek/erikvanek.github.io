<li><strong>Complication or the inciting incident</strong></li>
<li>the most important part of [[Storytelling]] is the <strong>inciting incident</strong> - this where the drama gets build and what sets the stage ready for proposing a solution</li>
<li>something that kickstarts the story, something that profoundly changes the world of the main character</li>
<li>e.g. the &quot;meet cute&quot; in romantic movies</li>
<li>nice inspiration from moves <a href="here">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwimvaj2XqQ</a></li>
<li>it might be helpful to support the inciting incident with some more attention as it is the key element of a story</li>
<li>without it the story basically never starts</li>
<li>something that pushes the main character out of the comfort zone</li>
</ul>
