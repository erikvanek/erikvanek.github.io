<h1 id="web-25">Web 25</h1>
<p>Finally I want to have a website structure that allows me to work with it efficiently and maintain it long-term without the need to re-engineer it every year or so.</p>
<h2 id="tools-used">Tools used</h2>
<ul>
<li>LLM-assisted code generator (mostly Claude for now)</li>
<li><code>eleventy.js</code> for now, but might switch to something else if it seems more efficient</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>For now, everything is sandboxed in <code>web-25</code> folder until ready to switch to a new version.</p>
<h3 id="sections">Sections</h3>
<p>My website consists of several sections that serve different purposes and are constructed differently</p>
<h4 id="landing-page">Landing page</h4>
<p>This is purely custom single site that is the entry point to my site.</p>
<h4 id="profile">Profile</h4>
<p>A self-contained HTML + CSS (or alternative) describing who I am and what I do</p>
<h4 id="components">Components</h4>
<p>Components like footer, navigation or call-to-action.</p>
<h4 id="case-studies">Case studies</h4>
<p>Each case study is a self-contained HTML + CSS (or alternative) that is fine-tuned for a specific use-case. It should build on top of existing visual hierarchy, but also should be able to position specifically based on needs.</p>
<h4 id="presentations-workshops">Presentations / workshops</h4>
<p>A set of presentations and guiding workshop slideware that I've gathered throughout years. Some of them are one-offs, some of them are in groups. Currently reusing some layouts between them, in future I'd like to have more reuse to make it simpler to create presentations in new contexts.</p>
<h4 id="plaiground">PlAIground</h4>
<p>Playing around with some tools. Not sharing context between them, usually just a quick prototype of some sort.</p>
<h4 id="sandbox">Sandbox</h4>
<p>Here are self-contained sandboxed projects that do not share anything in common. Usually just dropped files that serve one purpose with no need for further development.</p>
<h4 id="blog">Blog</h4>
<p>A set of semi-regular blog articles. It should be markdown only and should have shared CSS among them with some standard layout options and feats like code block, aligning images etc. Nothing fancy.</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Contents of my second brain. For now each note is just a simple markdown file with a default template that I can link to if needed. In future I'd like to build an interactive visualisation similar to Obsidian that showcases my second brain knowledge and allows me to travel through it.</p>
