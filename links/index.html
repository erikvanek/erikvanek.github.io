<p>A set of links that I found at some points interesting and inspiring.</p>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html">The tyranny of convenience</a> is a nice one about gig economy, hedonic adaptation, premium apps etc</li>

<h2>Teamwork</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/fast-company/this-is-the-one-skill-designers-need-to-develop-most-in-2020-c0ee1bb82955">This is the one skill designers need to develop most in 2020</a> - I believe this one applies to all contemporary white collar labor. Bridging silos seems to be one of the most challenging disciplins when working in cross-department environments. The skill of 'letting go' can open so many doors while insisting on your undebateable truths can close some of them forever.</li>
</ul>
