        <p>
            Childcare shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all solution. <strong>Every child deserves personalized attention
                in a
                nurturing environment that feels like home</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            That's the driving force behind my
            collaboration with the
            <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/en" target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs</a> to pilot a new
            childcare service called <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/cz/sousedske-detske-skupiny"
                target="_blank">Sousedsk√©
                dƒõtsk√©
                skupiny</a>. By offering care in the welcoming homes of motivated caregivers, we're creating a
            service that puts children and families first.

    <h3>How we're doing it?</h3>

    <div class="halved">
        <div class="bigger">
            <p>I'm collaborationg with a <a href="https://www.podporujemeinovace.cz/" target="_blank">department for
                    social innovations</a> at the ministry. The main aim of the project is to evaluate how the service
                proposition meets client's needs and to investigate how it could be improved in future. </p>

    <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
    <div class="halved">
        <div class="bigger">
            <ul>
                <li>There's a <strong>high demand for home-based childcare</strong> services. Balancing out client's and
                    system needs is a tricky task that has no simple solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consistent communication</strong> is key to work with public effectively

                <li>Day-to-day life at the <strong>ministry is resilient to innovation</strong> and discards data easily
                </li>
                <li>Piloting a service in a <strong>sandbox yields valueble data</strong> and allows us to focus on
                    problematic aspects</li>
                <li>Identifying <strong>relevant stakeholders</strong> inside the ministry is a must for success</li>

    <h3>Key outcomes</h3>
    <p>The main aim of the project was to identify if a service meets customer's and system needs before it is
        officially institutionalized. We managed to come up with several suggestions for further improvement and
        identified several bottlenecks that need to be mitigated for service to have a higher chance for
        success.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Leading innovative efforts in a public sector is a long and complex journey. Having a strong alignment with
            top
            management and key stakeholders is a key ingredient in a ridid structures that are resistant to change.</p>
        <p>Including potential service users during research and prototyping service aspects was a valuable source of
            feedback. People react
            well when approached by the ministery and are able to tolerate some imperfections along the way. </p>
