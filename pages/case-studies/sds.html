    <h1>Piloting a new childcare service</h1>
    <sub>(More details soon)</sub>
    <h2>Project goals</h2>
    <h3>Pilot a not-yet established childcare service with selected participants</h3>
    <p>The main aim of the project is to pilot a gradually emerging childcare service called <em>Sousedské dětské
            skupiny</em>. The
        rigid structure and rules obsessed environment turns this problem into a chicken-egg situation. The pilot programme
        can’t be started until the legislation is signed off and vice versa. That brings severe roadblocks and obstacles
        throughout the project lifetime.
    </p>
    <h3>Increase design awareness at the ministry</h3>
    <p>
        It is one of the first in-house led projects that involves designers’ expertise. One of the key goals is to share
        knowledge among colleagues about design approaches and techniques. We’re focusing strongly on co-creating with the
        rest of the project team to maximize the possibility to share knowledge.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Help the organization understand better user's needs
    </h3>
    <p>
        The project invests a lot of resources into understanding users’ needs to be able to configure service’s parameters
        correctly. We’re using a variation of methods like in-depth interviews, fake-door tests or ethnographic probes to
        understand what are the needs, motivations and expectations of our target groups.
    </p>
    <h3>Share lessons learnt and key findings with the innovation department</h3>
    <p>
        The value of the project is to share back with the innovation department what are the main obstacles to bring more
        innovation to the standard ways of working of the organization. We’re continuously documenting and sharing
        peculiarities and constraints that the ministry’s environment brings.
