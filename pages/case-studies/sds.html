        <p>
            Childcare shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all solution. <strong>Every child deserves personalized attention
                in a
                nurturing environment that feels like home</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            That was the driving force behind my
            collaboration with the
            <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/en" target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs</a> to pilot a new
            childcare service called <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/cz/sousedske-detske-skupiny"
                target="_blank">Sousedsk√©
                dƒõtsk√©
                skupiny</a>. By offering care in the welcoming homes of motivated caregivers, we're creating a
            service that puts children and families first.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How we're doing it?</h3>

    <div class="halved">
        <div class="bigger">
            <p>I collaborated with a <a href="https://www.podporujemeinovace.cz/" target="_blank">department for
                    social innovations</a> at the ministry. The main aim of the project was to identify client needs,
                evaluate the product-market fit and find ways to simplify the onboarding process for new clients of a
                service.</p>
            <h4>Activities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Understanding user needs</strong> by conducting interviews and ethnographic fieldwork
                </li>
                <li>Conducting cross-domain workshops to get <strong>insights from childcare professionals</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iterative validation and development</strong> of onboarding process and support artifacts
                </li>
                <li>Piloting a service proposition with prospective caregivers in an <strong>isolated sandbox</strong>
                    simulating real-life conditions
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <div class="halved">
        <div class="bigger">
            <ul>
                <li>There's a <strong>high demand for home-based childcare</strong> services. Parents with kids with
                    specific needs are especially attracted to this opportunity
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data advocacy allows for more user-centered approach</strong> during policy design by
                    leveraging insights gathered in user research</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consistent and straight-forward communication</strong> is an important ingredient to keep
                    public
                    audience engaged
                </li>
                <li>Day-to-day life at the <strong>ministry is resilient to innovation</strong> and opinions are valued
                    more than data
                </li>
                <li>Using a <strong>sandbox approach when piloting</strong> a service is a valuable instrument capable
                    of yielding data for further policy design process</li>
                <li>Efficient <strong>stakeholder engagement is a must</strong> when spreading research insights to
                    shape
                    policy design process
            </ul>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>The main aim of the project was to identify if a service meets customer's and system needs before it is
        officially institutionalized. We managed to come up with several suggestions for further improvement and
        identified several bottlenecks that need to be mitigated for service to have a higher chance for
        success.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Leading innovative efforts in a public sector is a long and complex journey. Having a <strong>strong
                alignment with
                top
                management and key stakeholders is an important ingredient</strong> in rigid structures that are
            resistant to
            change.</p>
        <p>We managed to shape the service and its further development to be more user-centered by actively including
            future users during its development. This allowed us to weed out some edge-cases and potential failures
            despite several pitfalls in participant involvement.
