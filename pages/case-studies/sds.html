    <section class="perex">
        <div>
            <p>I'm developing a new childcare service called <a
                    href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/cz/sousedske-detske-skupiny" target="_blank">Sousedské dětské
                    skupiny</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/en" target="_blank">Ministry
                    of Social
                    Affairs</a>. Inspiration for this home-based childcare comes from services like <a
                    href="https://www.xn--tagesmtter-feb.com/" target="_blank">Tagesmutter</a> in Germany or Austria.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to create an <strong>easy-to-use service that provides care
                    in the welcoming homes of caregivers</strong>. By offering small-group settings, we prioritize
                personal attention
                and foster a family-like atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>We are committed to <strong>understanding and meeting the needs of children, their families and service
                    providers
                    i.e. caregivers</strong>. We actively listen to
                their needs, potential roadblocks and feedback to shape our service better. We actively work with these
                data to ensure that the leadership can make the most informed decisions possible to make the service
                more customer-centric.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside this project, we are enhancing the design maturity of the organization. By
                <strong>fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and promoting customer-centricity</strong>, we
                strive to empower the Ministry of Social Affairs to embrace innovative,
                human-centered design approaches and techniques.

            <h3>Project goals</h3>
        </div>

        <h4>Understanding user and stakeholder needs</h4>
        <p>Through user research, we gain insights into the needs, motivations, and barriers of primary user groups and
            key
            stakeholders. This understanding helps us position the service effectively and sets clear boundaries for
            designing
            processes and tools.</p>

        <h4>Stakeholder alignment</h4>
        <p>Designing a public service involves aligning multiple stakeholders with different motivations, fears, and
            expectations. We work towards understanding each perspective to move the project forward effectively.</p>

        <h4>Service prototyping</h4>
        <p>We embrace an iterative, feedback-driven approach throughout the project. Storyboarding helps us empathize
            with user
            needs and identify process improvements. We test various artifacts <a
                href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/rite/" target="_blank">rapidly</a> to
            ensure
            they are delivered in the best possible way.</p>

            {% assign nalevyTitle = 'Service proposition fake door prototype. We used it in early prototyping to get

        </div>

        <h4>Human-centered design advocacy</h4>
        <p>
            By observing and understanding the challenges faced by project teams in bringing human-centered designs, we
            gather
            valuable insights for the organization. We document, share, and find ways to improve conditions for future
            innovation initiatives.

            <h3>Key outcomes</h3>
        </div>

        <h4>Pilot project development and facilitation</h4>
        <p>We created and conducted a comprehensive pilot project structure to validate the service
            proposition in the field. The <strong>aim of the pilot project is to simulate the service before the
                legislation</strong> is
            fully estabilished and approved. By facilitating key events and ensuring smooth
            execution, we successfully led the
            initiative from conception to completion.</p>

        {% assign nalevyPath = '/img/2024/case-studies/sds/blueprint-navsteva.png' %}
        {% assign nalevyTitle = 'Household approval process is a key part of service orchestration. Caregivers need to
        have their households formally approved to fullfill required criteria.' %}

        {% render 'figure.njk', path: nalevyPath, title: nalevyTitle %}

        <h4>Fostering remote collaboration</h4>
        <p>Despite the ministry's focus on in-person interactions, we created an efficient remote collaboration
            environment. Our ability to adapt and deliver successful outcomes, even in challenging circumstances,
            highlights our flexibility and problem-solving skills.</p>
        <h4>Promoting public participation</h4>
        <p>Through our facilitation of several round table and focus group sessions, we effectively included key
            stakeholders in the project. This inclusive approach garnered valuable insights and demonstrated our
            commitment to stakeholder engagement and public participation.</p>
        <h4>Building key partnerships</h4>
        <p>We prioritized establishing close contacts with key stakeholders, such as the ministry deputy, recognizing
            that top-level support is crucial for project success. By fostering collaboration with these influential
            actors, we were able to define and pursue critical project priorities.</p>
        <h4>Implementing iterative processes</h4>
        <p>Our team introduced an iterative approach to key activities, enabling faster feedback loops than typically
            experienced in the ministry environment. By inviting broader public collaboration, we showcased our ability
            to co-design public policies in a participative manner, leaving a positive impact and setting a new standard
            for engagement.</p>
