        Imagine the fear, uncertainty, and overwhelming emotions of facing
        imprisonment for the first time. In collaboration with
        <a href="https://sovia.cz/projekt/" target="_blank">Sovia</a>, we
        embarked on an innovation project to
        <strong>uncover the complex needs and mental states of individuals in
            this challenging situation</strong>. Explore how our findings could offer support, guiding individuals
        through this tough time towards a hopeful future.
    </p>
    <!-- </section> -->

        <h3>What was the process like?</h3>
        <p>
            We managed to get a deep understanding of problems associated with
            prison system by <strong>conducting in-depth interviews</strong> with people after
            receiving their court sentences. In combination with collaborative
            workshops and interviews with emerging stakeholders within whole
            esosystem, we realized how deep the problem is. We've also included imprisoned people to our co-creation
            process to validate our assumptions and to create contents of supporting materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conducting our research brought <strong>2 key challenges</strong> that we used for later phases of ideation:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>How might we create <strong>support systems to help individuals navigate</strong> the challenging
                transition period
                between receiving a court sentence and beginning incarceration?</li>
            <li>How might we <strong>equip social workers with the tools and training</strong> needed to better support
                individuals and
                their families during the pre-incarceration transition period?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="halved">
        <div class="bigger">
            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>We've gone through dozens of ideas or proposals of what could possibly help to overcome two challenges
                above. Eventually we picked the most promising ideas and shaped them into more detail. These were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In-depth instructions for what one needs to get done
                    after receiving a prison sentence in a written form
                <li>
                    Information architecture proposal for a site serving as knowledge base for people that have received
                    their sentence and their families
                </li>
                <li>
                    Training programme structure for professionals in helping
                    professions focused on key areas where most help is needed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Methodical questionnaire for professionals working
                    with our target group to help them evaluate their
                    situation and to help suggest actionable steps for their clients
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advocation effort with key stakeholders to strenghten possible impact of our efforts
                </li>
                <li>
                    We managed to transfer important knowledge to representatives of several social services
                    participating in our collaborative workshops as a nice side-effect of our effort

        <h2>How did we get there?</h2>

        <p>
            We managed to get a deep understanding of problems associated with
            prison system by conducting in-depth interviews with people after
            receiving their court sentences. In combination with collaborative
            workshops and interviews with emerging stakeholders within whole
            esosystem, we realized how deep the problem is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually we decided to focus our effort on several tools and
            initiatives, that are most impactful and are within our reach. These
            were namely:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Content structure for a website</strong> supporting
                people that have just received their court sentence and there
                closest surroundings
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Handy leaflet focused on smooth onboarding</strong> to
                the prison that can be distributed in various services that are
                in touch with our target group
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Redesign of an official letter</strong> that is
                distributed before onboarding to the prison which is hard to
                decipher
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Manual for workers</strong> in social services to assess
                needs when being visited by clients from our target group
            </li>
        </ul>

                    We focused on creating several tools that might help fill in
                    identified gap in the system. Our aim was to get the most
                    amount of relevant feedback to address later and then
                    fine-tuning our proposals based on this feedback.

                        Created prototypes of several tools that might be used

                        <em>or</em>
                        workers in services where our target group seeks help
