❤️ grattitude alert ❤️

I've embarked on probably one of the most interesting journeys so far recently
Eying design since ever but never felt like switching from a comfy engineering chair
Being part of infarm layoff rounds felt like a great opportunity to fully jump on a new challenge
Since then I make my living as a freelance designer and facilitator in various fields like public services, NGOs and or also for private clients
What's great is I can hone different skills in different environments - hacking together a small app or a website, consulting a database restructuring in a NGO or public sphere is quite often somehow rare and valuable skill
On the other hand - technological companies often lack the 'soft' aspect of things when talking to their partners like users, clients or suppliers. I often bridge gaps between departments. Also I can bridge efficiently between design and engineering.
I'm not big on celebrations but in recent months I had a chance to work on a project that recently got awarded as a most innovative public service effort in Czechia in 2024. I've researched how innovative teams in czech public services work and how they difer to 'standard teams'. I've organized a follow-up co-creation workshop with several ministry secretaries and HR managers focused on baby-stepping innovations in their offices. After tutoring a class in last spring semester, I've led a whole class of students in Service design workshop class at MUNI.

All of this would not be possible without so many incredible people I've met in last two or three years. I don't want to name specifically as it's hard to draw the line who to name and who to not. Some of you are profficient linkediners, some of those unicorns as I call them are not even present here. It can be project colleagues, research participants, class mates (yep I study again). Some of those people I often refer to might be interested how much they influenced me by their presence.

I don't mean this to brag. Linkedin feels a bit too cliche. But hey - who cares? Thanks to all great people around. I learned to show grattitude in last years. So at least some of you know who I mean by this. And if you've read so far and we're in touch in last two three years – there's a high chance you're of them. And if not - that's OK. People come and go. I love when more good people come than go. And I hope it stays like this for quite some time.

One emotional one - returning to my hometown Zlín (feel free to ask me why I call it Evilville) for a panel discussion during ZDW. Also you can find me workshoppin' at FKB in late June. And meanwhile I'll try to earn some buck as quite a high percentage of those 'interesting' endavours is unpaid or poorly paid labor. Sad but true.

Cheers ❤️
