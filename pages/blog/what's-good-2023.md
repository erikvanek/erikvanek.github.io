- what I've done up until now
  - software, a bit of traveling, a bit of hydroponics
  - always wearing a design part-time but never dove into it fully
- [infarm broke down](My infarm journey)
- what now?
  - feel good in Brno even despite its recent (and more coming soon) problems
  - a bit tired of 'corporate' world (never been exactly in a corporate but still...)
  - agilizing social/public services
- my aim?
  - bring my ~ 10 years experience to ridig contexts
  - get better/fill in my gaps at research
  - feel good about what I do :)
    - by far the most meaningful work I've done so far
