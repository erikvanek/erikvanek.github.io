- soil-less for future
- moving to Berlin
  - fun
  - not fun
- diversity!
- profesionalization good (technically) & bad (vibe-wise)
- hypergrowth causes
  - improper "solutions", often plasters
  - does not consider people, they are more of human resource
- energy crises shows that this is not a silver bullet to feed 10BLN ppl in 2050
- can make sense somehwere with cheap energy & little water (Scandinavia, Africa possibly (pricey tho), ...)
- fun, joyful (friends, Berlin, learnings) but also sad (burnouts, ppl treatment) journey
- time to move on :)
