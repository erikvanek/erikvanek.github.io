Why? Because it's dope & fun ðŸ˜Š

## Main attractions
If you're up for visiting churches, cathedrals or a castle - there's a plethora of guides on the internetz to help you. What Brno does best though is its unique and affordable gastronomy. There's a Brno's mythical tripod - coffe, cake & beer. You can find many places where you can actually get all of these in a great quality at once like Jaga (formerly called Atlas), Sesta vetev or Podnebi.
Let me suggest you my favourite places around town and why they're so good. I'll just limit each category to three places so that it's not overwhelming.
