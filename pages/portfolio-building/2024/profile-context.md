What specific experiences or projects have most shaped your approach to service design?


It already started while ago when working for a Berlin-based startup called infarm where I was focusing on the product holistically.

After Infarm I've started to look for clients that are close to something that can be called social innovation. I was part of several projects in various roles, mainly involved as a service designer. My technical experience is really helpful as usually people in these contexts are not that tech savvy.

Biggest projects I was participating on recently are linked to the Ministry of social welfare and their social innovation grant scheme. I'm also collaborating with innovation agencies or small NGOs on their activities. As a side-gig I like to dig into cultural segment.

What has shaped me the most was the contrast between the tech segment and public sector which usually works in rather different pace and values different traits.

How do you typically help clients discover their "unknown unknowns"?

The sooner I find what are their pain points the sooner I can try looking around for some evidence to build some knowledge in their field of interest.

I like to rely on qualitative research. Usually in forms of interviews or focus groups, world cafes and similar formats. That happens in the discovery phase.

What is quite helpful afterwards is to organize collaborative ideation workshops that often reveal interesting insights and possibilities about what could be done further. Ideally by mixing people with diferent expertise together.

I also like to bring metaphors or inspirations from different fields. As I have an experience from a broad range of fields, I oftren brings unexpected inspirations and experiences from "somewhere else".

Could you share a brief story of how your technical background has enhanced a service design project?

For example I'm able to wire together pretty quickly a technical prototype with high fidelity by scraping down a site, editing its content and then showing it to users. Or wiring together a quick clickable dummy is also pretty easy for me if I need what needs to be shown.

I've also recently experimented with AI-infused prorotyping. My technical skills allow me to use modern AI tools efficiently and thus I can come up with more fine tuned solutions.

I can also help a lot with using different PM tools and agile practices that are important for smooth collaboration.

Also knowing how things work technicaly work under the hood can be helpful. Sometimes I bridge the gap between domain knowledge of some organizations that don't have an idea about what are possible technical implications of what they are doing. I can be a helpful consultant in those scenarios.

What's your philosophy on balancing innovation with practical implementation?

I think it is super important not to end up in a third diamond but to focus strongly on delivery at the end of the design process.

I am greatful if I can focus well on initial research because without it we can't make good decisions. But after that's done I like to be pretty iterative and move in fast, quick and dirty iterations to validate my assumptions. The easier I can discard or lock in to the idea, the better.


How do you typically handle resistance to change in organizations?

This depends on the context of each organization.

The best way is to get the buy in from the top level management and this is how I like to start my collaborations from now on. I don't want to end up in limbos where I'm building something for later because people are not interested in buying it internally.

What also helps a lot is to understand the key motivations of those, that resist the change and then work with it proactively. Active listening can be a valuable tool here that allows me to uncover what might be potentially 'the need behind the need' of resisting the change.

What unique perspective do you bring from your startup experience that benefits public sector clients?

Focus on fast iteration, technical experties, the value of cross-department collaboration, the willingness to make errors (public sector is so deeply afraid of that). I also like to break silos which are pretty strong public spheres.

Could you describe a challenging project that showcases your problem-solving approach?

When working on a new child care service for the Ministry of social welfare, my biggest hurdle was to figure out what is the hidden force behind my work not being accepted.

Eventually with a colleague we found out that there is a strong resistance to change and so we figured out we need to get to the top management of the ministry to get our job approved by the middle management. So this was not technically a problem solving in a project, but more in how to sell it to the rest of the team.

Once we managed that, we could more freely do what we were hired for. We mapped what are client pain points, we tested and iterated content of various touchpoints with them, designed an innovation programme for participants in our pre-school care incubator. The main challenge was to find possible innovations for that new service. By designing the incubator we've inverted to control and offloaded to those participants. That was rather elegant solution that yielded multiple good points from those that are most affected and know the most about the subject.

How do you maintain the balance between being a consultant and an educator for your clients?

I am helpful if I can teach others but if I'm not tasked to do that, I try to focus on my goal and my main assignemnt.

Though with one of my recent clients I organized an internal workshop on human-centered design principles and it received a great appraisal so maybe I can do that more in future.

What principles guide your stakeholder management approach?

I try to be direct, data-driven and I try to help them achieve their goals. I try not to play any games and thus I'm a bit upset when I figure out it's not the case in their case.

I take my practice as something that should help them achieve their goals. I'm a tool that they can use to achieve them and I'm happy to be facilitating the path to get there.

How do you measure the success of your service design interventions?

So far not that much. But what I try to have in mind is some sort of basic demographics when working on projects.

Based on that demographics it is easier to prioritize which user segments are the most important ones.

Given the fact that I was working more on public services recently with sadly no clearly defined goals or metrics, it is a bit difficult to measure the impact.

On the other hand say at Infarm, the company grew 8x times during the time I was contributing to their success. And since one of the biggest goals of the company was hyper-growth, I think I helpe a lot to achieve that specific goal.
