# Hi, I'm Erik Vaněk

My name is Erik Vaněk and I help organizations create better products and services by understanding what people really need. Through collaborative design and practical experiments, I create solutions that work for both users and organizations.

## My innovation journey

My experience in tech startups showed me how valuable it is when teams work together across departments to solve complex challenges. This learning led me to my design practice, where I now help organizations from early-stage startups to public institutions transform ideas into impactful solutions. Each project strengthens my belief that innovation happens when different perspectives come together.

## How I work?

I believe in testing ideas early to learn what works and what to discard. By building on solid research data, we can identify the real challenges worth solving.

Strong emphasis on collaboration when developing solutions allows me to get the most out of every team's unique expertise. While I am happy working remotely, I prioritize in-person sessions for workshops and critical collaborative moments.
