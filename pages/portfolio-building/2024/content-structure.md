aim: landing page content structure

The site is divided into 5 key sections:

-   claim
-   small call to action
-   key ingredients
-   my experience
-   call to action

More thorough description of each is below.

# Claim

The main aim is to attract the visitor visually. The claim should be bold enough but also nudging so that the client should be motivated to read futher.

## Content

<!-- "Reach your goals by building impactful services to satisfy your clients." -->

"Maximize your potential to achieve ambitious goals through collaborative innovation"

<!-- "Maximize your potential to achieve ambitious goals via collaborative innovation." -->

# Small call to action

This section should describe in a bit more detail what is what I can help organizations with. It is some sort of "perex" of my offering.

## Content

"I guide my clients through the process, that reveals what their clients' true needs are. That allows us to design and deliver them meaningful experiences that meet their needs."

# Key ingredients

This section should crisply and understandably describe what are the benefits of hiring me to help my clients. The focus should be here on delivering value to them, thus contributing to those goals they have defined.

This section will be then visually displayed as some sort of cards, or "feats" or something like that.

## Content

### Empathy

It is key to understand whare the needs, pains and constraints of your clients.

### Agile approach

Strict prioritization of what's the next most important thing to build while adhering to long-term strategy.

### Short feedback loops

To ensure we're on the right track and that we're building the thing right.

# My experience

This should showcase what I can bring to table and what distinguishes me from some competitors on the market.

## Content

I've spent nearly a decade in software industry in various roles ranging from engineer, through designer to a product manager. I eventually found my sweet spot in the field of service design, where I can leverage my expertise from technological field. I like to combine it with my deep interest in people, their motivations and behavior.

## Recent work

This section we can leave out for now. It will showcase some case studies but we'll get there in a bit.

## Call to action

The most important section for conversion. So the idea is that the content above has motivated a visitor to want to get to know me. Preferably via booking a slot in calendly. Or via some additional methods. I don't have any content here and would be happy if you can create some for me.
