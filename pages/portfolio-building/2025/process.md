# How does my process look like
I focus on two key components when working with clients – finding and shaping **the right challenge to invest time into** and **finding the right solution(s) to that problem**.

# Shaping challenges
Our culture is focused on problem solving. But when we're trying to solve the wrong problem, we might easily waste resources like time, well-being or money. By focusing on **findihg the right problem to solve**, we tackle this risk and save resources in the long run.

What we might do together?
- **find patterns and trends** in what you already know – my clients are usually experts in their fields and thus know the context of their domains pretty well
- conduct a **deep dive** research into existing research reports, trends in your field or best practices among your competitors or field leaders
- we'll probably **define research plan and objectives** to find out more about the problem if we realize that we don't know about it enough (which happens most of the time)
- we'll **frame and reframe** the problem we want to tackle continuously until we're happy with its shape and scope based on our continuous learning

# Solving problems the right way
TBD
- you are the SME
- I help you cut through the problem and slice it and do it in agile way
- balancing out tactical and strategic (prioritization, ...)
- validation (product market fit, ...)
