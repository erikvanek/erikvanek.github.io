I offer my services as a service designer. Clients I'm interested in are small to mid-sized startups, public services, companies with purpose or NGOs.

Main aim of my website is to showcase my unique skillset, experience and what I managed to achieve with my clients so far.

Here are some key questions and answers that summarize my offering and positioning. In general I want my site to communicate with words, that are easy to understand to my potential clients. I want to avoid design-specific language because the design maturity of clients I work with is usually low. Also it is key to focus on crisp and easy to digest language as I don't want to offput people with content they don't understand. Also be aware of the fact that clients coming to my site might not know that they need services like service design can offer them. So it is important to 'educate' them about those unknown unknowns they are facing but maybe are not able to articulate yet.

Who is your ideal client or target audience?

1. an organization that wants to create a new service or experience or wants to refresh or optimze an existing one, it can be a public service like a ministry, it can be an NGO, more and more I'd like to focus on early-stage starups and mid-sized scale-ups. So consider how service design can be beneficial to those.

What are the top 3 pain points or challenges your clients typically face?

2. Not knowing what are the needs of their users and clients. Lack of feedback loops and not knowing that it is a problem not having enough feedback. Low design maturity of their organization. Public services and NGO have problems with digital competencies and project and product management.

Can you describe your unique approach to service design? What sets you apart from other freelancers in your field?

3. My strength comes from the fact that I've been part of successful startups for several years and I've seen them grow, helped them to fullfill their goals and KPIs so that they could pursue new funding rounds. Also I have a unique combination of technical and product management skills together with research abilities. I'm a very mindful observer and have a strong sense of empathy and can facilitate group discussions well. Also recent experience from a ministry context helped me to hone my skills in stakeholder management. I am a good team member that focuses on eliminating impediments during delivery, values short feedback loops and lean approach.

What specific results or outcomes have you achieved for your clients?

4. My recent technological client have seen a tremendous growth when I was part of its software team. I helped to scale the team 8x during 3 years. Afterwards I was a pioneering designer for one of the first innovation projects under the lead of Ministry of social welfare. Some other side projects were considered as rather successful by juries that are judging their results and impact. Also I was highly praised as a creative and constructive team member during those collaborations.

Do you have any case studies or success stories you'd like to highlight?

5. Yes I would like to showcase 3 case studies. One is my last tech gig at a company called infarm. Sadly I don't have much visual evidence I can showcase, but I have some things I can write about my time being there. The second one is that pioneering innovative service design project for the Ministry of social welfare where I showcased several key skills. The last project is the one I've led from design perspective from end to end. I have some artifacts and remarks I can showcase. It is worth mentioning that I would not like to showcase those case studies in depth on the site, I'd like to have only sneakpeaks as they have some sensitive data I should now show to the public.

What industries or sectors do you specialize in or have the most experience with?

6. As mentioned before - early stage and mid-sized startups, public services, NGOs. I would actually like to attract more technical clients again as it is an environment with a 'can do' approach compered to those first two.

How would you describe your working style or process when collaborating with clients?

7. My key principle is to settle down on a reasonable framing first. That is the key part. Quite often I'm tasked with a generic assignment and after some investigation, we figure out that the problem is somewhere else. Rather than giving them fish, I like to teach them how to fish. My process is rather collaborative, relying on teamwork, is data-driven to be able to make informed decisions and then I focus strongly on short feedback loops that allow us to move and pivot quickly if needed. Also I like to run periodic workshops mainly to align everyone on the same side.

What are the key benefits clients can expect when working with you?

8. Clear communication, adhering to best practices, attention to detail and focus on our main goals. I value pragmatism over idealism and like to keep things simple and I believe in agile practices and shofrt feedback loops.

Do you offer any specific services or packages that you'd like to promote on your landing page?

9. I would like to showcase a typical service design process. But not using a typical double diamond lingo as clients might not understand it. I want the landing page to be foucsed on those clients and on their needs. Their needs are then formed into my assignments. They don't need to speak design language in order to be able to understand the site.

What is the primary action you want visitors to take when they land on your website (e.g., schedule a call, send an email, fill out a contact form)?

10. Preferred is calendly, then email, then a phone call.
