- great advertising speaks to the customer's struggling moment
## Behavior
- a dissatisfied customer does not complain, he just switches
- customers **don't care about features of a product but if it helps** then get closer to getting their job done
- **when you design for a specific outcome, customers leave once the outcome is achieved**; when designing for improving customer's live, then it never ends
- **people don't buy things just to have them**, but they want to make their lives better i. e. make progress
- there must be a true desire for change in order to hire a product or a service
- **people say â‰  people do** e. g. Ryanair is one of the worst brands but the company grows rapidly
- What people are doing is not the same as what they are trying to accomplish
	- focusing on the **outcome** rather than on a given activity that needs to happen
- using a product/service starts with hiring -> using -> firing

## Needs
- needs and wants change in time and do not belong to the customer
- a need represents **an interaction between the customer, their desire for Progress, and the product they hired for [[JTBD]]**
- "customer wants" come from the system, not from customers
	- if you want to persuade customers to use your product you either have to outcompete a current solution, or make the customer change their [[JTBD]] thus want a new solution
- Unmet [[Goal]] is a future experience a [[Customer]] wants, but can't get at the moment
