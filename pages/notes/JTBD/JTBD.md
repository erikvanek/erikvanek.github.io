- **JTBD is a theory**, that should be able to describe what happened in the past but also what might happen in future
- provides **a framework for finding out what the user really wants** and what causes them to a given purchase or usage of a product or a service
## Job
- **a job is the progress an individual is trying to make** in a particular *circumstance**
- everytime we're on **a path to transform our life to something else** - we have a Job to be done
- _Job_ is shorthand for what an individual really seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance
	- When we buy a product, **we essentially “hire” it** to help us do a job
- a JTBD does not surprisingly appear – **it is properly designed**
- JTBD is the **process one goes through in need to transform an existing life situation into a preferred one** but cant because of existing constraints
- Compare JTBD versus user stories [here](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27)
- is **best used at the early stages of a product design** process it will help you identify innovate and grow your product. It looks at the bigger picture of possibilities and options.

- JTBD can be visualised with a storytelling arc - [[Inciting accident]] can be the first exposition to the means that can get the job done
- an inspiration can be found in [[Activity-centered design]]
- a guiding star to JTBD is the customers' [[Motivation]] to better their lives
	- focusing on functionality will distract you
	- e. g. going to a theatre with a kid is not only about the act, but also about making *their lives better* by having a shared experience so that they can talk about concepts and share life lessons
- customer jobs **don't tell me which innovation to make** but what are my m customers struggling with; it helps me identify how can I make their lives better and what they value and don't value in a solution
- JTBDs evolve with customer's maturity and business needs/ goals
- **it isn't customer's job to know what they want, often they don't know what they want until you slow then**
- it is a process – it starts, runs and eventually ends
## Principles
- people have jobs, things don't
- the things that people want to accomplish in their lives don’t change quickly and thus **JTBD are pretty stable**
- opportunities exist when people show compensatory behavior
- **favor progress (now and in future) over outcomes and [[Goal]]**
- **progress defines valve, contrast reveals value** and thus products without context have no value
	- e. g. the value of a steak changes based on contex
	- at kid's bday party versus a fancy restaurant
- solutions for jobs deliver value also between usages of a tool
- the value of the system is how it works together as a whole
## Phrasing
- Well phrased JTBD can suit my product as well as my competitor
- **Frame design challenges by JTBD to persuade teammates and management** to change a product-with that you motivate innovators (i. e. problem solvers) to find solutions to the problem
- being able to distill the core JTBD then allows to position value properly
- eliminating customer's need to make a tradeoff to beat the competitor
- final JTBD should be portable so that everyone in the organization can use it
- JTBD has a good balance between concrete and abstract, between high and low levels
- 3 rules when forming them from [here](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done-old/jobs-to-be-done-examples/)
	- Keep it customer-centric
	- Focus on the functional (not the emotional)
	- Think bigger than your product function
- it should
	1) help work team together
	2) describe "a better me" for the customer
	3) should avoid describing how customers use your product
- might use emphasis on struggle brings verbs like give me, make me, help me, ... _which reminds us that the success comes from using a solution
- TBD wording should name a solution it has replaced
- **When in doubt if something is a JTBD** – ask "Can I visualize someone doing this?" and" Does this describe an action?" and if you answer" yes", you are probably describing a solution
- Could be framed as [Job stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27)

## Process
- identity a struggling point → qualify it → help people imagine how better their life would be with a different solution and help to deliver progress to clients during that proces

## Scaling
- consider splitting products and services based on different JTBD to avoid bulky solutions and losing focus
- **shift from selling one complicated product into multiple**, that form a cohesive system together e.g. Lean Canvas → Lean Stack
## Context
- knowing the context of the struggle helps to know how to grow the product
- grow your business by delivering progress
## [[Opposing forces of customer demand]]

## [[System of progress]]
## Promoting TBD in an organization
- use these questions to kickstart discussion in a team
1) How are customers struggling?
2) What is pushing their need for a new solution?
3) Without describing the feature – how would their life will be better once they started using it?
4) what is preventing customers from using that solution?
- agree on these and then verify in-field
- with this we're selling it as a verification of our assumption, not introducing a new framework which should make it easier
## JTBD flavors

- jobs-as-activities
	- similar to Norman's [[Activity-centered design]]
- jobs-as-progress
	- How things are today (actual self) → I need something to make this change (progress) → How I want things to be (desired self)
