# Outcome-Driven Product Strategy

## Key Principles (from Outcomes over Output)
- An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results
- Outcomes are delivered by changing customer behavior
- Ideally achieve an outcome by delivering as few features as possible
- Finished feature ≠ value delivery
- Program-logic-model: activities → outputs → outcome → impact

## The Three Magic Questions
1. What are the user and customer actions that drive business results?
2. How can we make people do more of these actions?
3. How do we know that we're right?

## From Outputs to Outcomes
- Instead of focusing on lists of features, manage a list of hypotheses with expected metrics
- Outcome = problem focused, output = solution focused
- Great starting question: "What customer/user/employee behaviors has this initiative created that drives business results?"
- Example reframe: "IDP redesign" → "boost sales by 10% from IDP"
- Develop a theory: "if we decrease the bounce rate, the users will complete the checkout at a higher rate"

## Outcome-Based Planning
- Center roadmaps around sets of outcomes rather than features
- Identify a system of outcomes that taken together will create the result you want
- Be honest about what you know and don't know, fill gaps by gathering appropriate data
- When thinking about metrics, ask: "if we were successful with this initiative, what would be different about customer's behavior?"

## Customer Understanding (from The Mom Test)
- The measure of usefulness of early customer interviews is whether they give us facts about customer's lives and world views 
- Focus on what customers do, not what they say they might do
- Plan what are the most important three things you want to learn from each person
- Ask for an interview using format: Vision → Framing → Weakness → Pedestal → Help

## Experimentation
- Power combo: outcome-based approach combined with experiments
- When you use outcomes to build your plans, you make progress by running experiments
- Test hypotheses to verify your outcome assumptions
- MVP is an example of an experiment
- Everything is an experiment
