# Customer Research

## Key Principles (from The Mom Test)
- Be genuinely interested about the people to open their hearts
- The measure of usefulness of early customer interviews is whether they give us facts about our customer's lives and world views
- "Talk me through the last time [it] happened" is a great question promoting show don't tell
- The big mistake is to mention your idea too soon rather than too late
- Customers own the problem, builders own the solution

## Detecting Signal vs. Noise
- Be wary of bad data: compliments and fluff
- Banned verbs: would/could/might - these indicate hypothetical situations, not reality
- Cut down fluff by anchoring to the real
- Don't prematurely zoom in unless you're pretty sure you're zooming into the right thing
- Plan what are the most important three things you want to learn from each person

## Finding the Right Customers (from both books)
- Look for deep emotions - keep people close who say "This is the worst part of my life and you can help me fix it"
- Customer segments are who-where pairs
- Customer segmentation as a tool not to drown in a myriad of options
- Before we can serve everyone, we must serve someone
- From Outcomes over Output: Ask "What are the user and customer actions that drive business results?"

## Connecting Research to Outcomes (from Outcomes over Output)
- Understand what customers are doing that drives the results we care about
- Use customer journey maps to visualize behavior (which relates to outcomes)
- After visualizing, ask "what behaviors at each step predict failure/success"
- This helps define boosters/blockers for desired outcomes
- Remember: The goal of early stages is learning, revenue is a side-effect
