## Finding the right problem
- solving the **root cause of the right problem** than makes the symptom (usually what people perceive to be the problem) disappear
- Focus on [[JTBD]]
## Rest
- YOUR NEW USER IS THE DECISION MAKERs
- YOUR NEW USER JOURNEY IS THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS
- [assumptions mapping](https://www.mural.co/blog/intro-assumptions-mapping) is a tool how to mitigate different stakeholder perspectives or views
	- assumptions are fine but mark them as assumptions - I'd rather know that assumptions are assumptions then being tricked by them later
- _"for every 45 mins of a workshop I have a 45 minutes working out who should be there - the key is to identify the right people to have in the room"_ - Angela Arnold
- **the goal is get everyone on the same page
- two halves
	- business half
	- user half
- _the business wants to get to the outcome but only can see the output, our role is to help them see beyond outputs_
- Decisions are made and tracked _somewhere else_
	- don't mix decision making and tracking
- Problem statement roughly corresponds to the epic
	- epic title should not be vague but way more specific
	- __the problem describes the shift in customer behavior__
- _The goal of problem framing is not what to do, but what not to do and to remove the distraction from the most efficient thing to do_
- [[Storytelling]] gives problem a life and sustains it
- 5 Ws:
	- What
		- What is the focus of the problem?
		- What supporting evidence is there about this problem?
	- Who
		- Who is affected by the problem?
		- How do we know?
		- How are their voices present in the problem statement?
	- Where
		- Where does this problem occur?
		- How does the context of the problem impact its expression?
	- When
		- When does the problem occur - and what is the timeframe in which it has developed?
	- Why
		- Why is this problem worth addressing?
		- What impact will addressing it have?
## "Pre-framing" a problem
- what if we want to frame a problem we don't have enough information about?
	- then we can talk about framing a research plan and objectives
