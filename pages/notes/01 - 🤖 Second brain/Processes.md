# Data flowing in
There are two main entry points to my second brain knowledge management
## 02 - üì© Inbox
- relevant process for inbox processing described in [[Inbox processing]]
## 03 - üóëÔ∏è Dump
- resources that I find "interesting" but don't have the time to focus on them for now, it's resources that might get handy at times but there's no usage for them now
- the process is still TBD but it is sketched in [[Dump processing]]
# Rules
- Skip folder `Obsolete` as it includes previously generated rules and processes that do not suit me anymore
- Do not actively work (meaning do not process them, but feel free to reference them from new notes) with entries in `99-To process` as those are my old-not-yet-processed notes that I'll start processing gradually and eventually they move from that folder into my main Knowledge folder

# Knowledge Organization
## Maps of Content (MOCs)
MOCs serve as conceptual maps that provide an overview of a knowledge area. They are separate markdown files that collect related content from across your second brain.

- Start by creating MOCs only in the Resources section:
  - In Resources folder: Create MOCs for major topics of interest
  - Focus on topics where you have accumulated significant knowledge
  - Consider expanding to Projects and Areas later if beneficial
- MOCs should include:
  - Brief description of the topic
  - Key sub-topics with links to relevant notes
  - Important connections to other domains
  - Suggested entry points for exploration

MOCs are not comprehensive indexes but curated guides that evolve as your knowledge expands.
