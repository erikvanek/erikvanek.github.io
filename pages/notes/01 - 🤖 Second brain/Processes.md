# Data flowing in
There are two main entry points to my second brain knowledge management
## 02 - 📩 Inbox
- relevant process for inbox processing described in [[Inbox processing]]
## 03 - 🗑️ Dump
- resources that I find "interesting" but don't have the time to focus on them for now, it's resources that might get handy at times but there's no usage for them now
- the process is still TBD but it is sketched in [[Dump processing]]
# Rules
- Skip folder `Obsolete` as it includes previously generated rules and processes that do not suit me anymore
- Do not actively work (meaning do not process them, but feel free to reference them from new notes) with entries in `99-To process` as those are my old-not-yet-processed notes that I'll start processing gradually and eventually they move from that folder into my main Knowledge folder
