# Data flowing in
There are two main entry points to my second brain knowledge management
## 02 - üì© Inbox
- Inbox serves as the initial entry point for new notes
- Notes are processed according to the workflow in [[Inbox processing]]
- After processing, enhanced notes are moved to the RAW folder and deleted from Inbox
## 03 - üóëÔ∏è Dump
- Resources that I find "interesting" but don't have the time to focus on them for now, it's resources that might get handy at times but there's no usage for them now
- The process is still TBD but it is sketched in [[Dump processing]]
# Rules
- Skip folder `Obsolete` as it includes previously generated rules and processes that do not suit me anymore
- Do not actively work (meaning do not process them, but feel free to reference them from new notes) with entries in `99-To process` as those are my old-not-yet-processed notes that I'll start processing gradually and eventually they move from that folder into my main Knowledge folder

# Knowledge Organization
## RAW Storage Structure
- RAW notes are stored in a hierarchical structure based on creation date:
  - Format: `04 - üíΩ RAW/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[DAY]/[NOTE_TITLE].md`
  - Example: `04 - üíΩ RAW/2025/04/06/Interaction_Design.md`
- This structure helps with:
  - Finding notes by when they were created
  - Organizing content chronologically
  - Maintaining a clean folder structure

## Maps of Content (MOCs)
MOCs serve as conceptual maps that provide an overview of a knowledge area. They are separate markdown files that collect related content from across your second brain.

- Start by creating MOCs only in the Resources section:
  - In Resources folder: Create MOCs for major topics of interest
  - Focus on topics where you have accumulated significant knowledge
  - Consider expanding to Projects and Areas later if beneficial
- MOCs should include:
  - Brief description of the topic
  - Key sub-topics with links to relevant notes
  - Important connections to other domains
  - Suggested entry points for exploration

MOCs are not comprehensive indexes but curated guides that evolve as your knowledge expands.
