## 02 - ðŸ“© Inbox
- Inbox contains notes that I have compiled by myself by learning from various sources - books, articles, videos
### Process
- Take a look at what is in a given note and assign 5 tags to it based on [[Tagging]] process
- Use appropriate templates from [[01 - ðŸ¤– Second brain/Templates/note-template|Note Template]] for structured processing
- make a short summary between 5-7 sentences for notes that are longer than 800 characters, create a section on top of that note called `AI-assisted summary` and add the summary below
- Find 5 related nodes in my existing knowledge base that this nugget is related to, create a section `Related notes` at the end of the file and link those related notes as bullet points
- For longer notes (over 500 characters), consider using the [[Chunking]] process to break them into more focused, interconnected notes
- Include `date-created` for each raw note and store it in `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW` folder - so far just in linear structure, don't add any folder structure yet
- **important** - fow now - keep processed notes in the inbox folder, just move them to 'processed' - this is a safety net in case there's something wrong with the process

# Typical information coming in
## Notes
- it is "passive" knowledge that I gathered somewhere
	- notes from books, articles, podcasts, attended lectures, conferences or classes
## Research artifacts
- Interview and workshop debriefs notes, post-mortems and learning
- Research plans, scripts and reports
## Serendipity moments
- "A-ha moments" in shower, toilet, while biking etc
- These are going to be pretty small
## Design artefacts
- prototypes, test results, boundary objects and results when doing some further research with them
## Reflections
- weekly or monthly recaps and learnings on what went well and what did not and maybe with some actionables
