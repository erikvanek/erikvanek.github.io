# 02 - ðŸ“© Inbox
- Inbox contains notes that I have compiled by myself by learning from various sources - books, articles, videos
## Process
- Take a look at what is in a given note and assign 5 tags to it based on [[Tagging]] process
- Use appropriate templates from [[01 - ðŸ¤– Second brain/Templates/note-template|Note Template]] for structured processing
## Related nodes
- Find 5 related nodes in my existing knowledge base (only in folders `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge`) that this nugget is related to, create a section `Related notes` at the end of the file and link those related notes as bullet points
	- If you don't find enough related notes in those two subfolders, it's fine
## AI-assisted summary
- **!important** only for notes longer than 1500 characters, create a section on top called `AI-assisted summary` with a concise summary of the main ideas
  - Structure this summary into at least two paragraphs for better readability
  - First paragraph should cover the core concept/main idea
  - Second paragraph should expand on application, implications, or specific details
  - Aim for 5-7 sentences total across these paragraphs
  - then add horizontal line
## Chunking
- For longer notes (over 500 characters), consider using the [[Chunking]] process to break them into more focused, interconnected notes
## Storage
- Inbox serves as the entrypoint to new knowledge
- **important workflow clarification** - After processing, the note should be:
  1. Enhanced with proper metadata, tags, AI summary, and related notes
  2. Stored in the `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW` folder following a hierarchical structure:
     - Create folders based on the note's creation date from frontmatter metadata
     - Structure: `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[DAY]/[NOTE_TITLE].md`
     - Example: For a note created on April 6, 2025: `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/Note_Title.md`
  3. Deleted from the Inbox folder after being properly stored in RAW
  4. Smaller nuggets of information may be created and connected to most relevant notes in `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge` folder if appropriate
# Typical information coming in
## Notes
- it is "passive" knowledge that I gathered somewhere
	- notes from books, articles, podcasts, attended lectures, conferences or classes
## Research artifacts
- Interview and workshop debriefs notes, post-mortems and learning
- Research plans, scripts and reports
## Serendipity moments
- "A-ha moments" in shower, toilet, while biking etc
- These are going to be pretty small
## Design artefacts
- prototypes, test results, boundary objects and results when doing some further research with them
## Reflections
- weekly or monthly recaps and learnings on what went well and what did not and maybe with some actionables
