# 02 - ðŸ“© Inbox
- Inbox contains notes that I have compiled by myself by learning from various sources - books, articles, videos
## Process
- Take a look at what is in a given note and assign 5 tags to it based on [[Tagging]] process
- Use appropriate templates from [[01 - ðŸ¤– Second brain/Templates/note-template|Note Template]] for structured processing
## Related nodes
- Find 5 related nodes in my existing knowledge base (only in folders `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge`) that this nugget is related to, create a section `Related notes` at the end of the file and link those related notes as bullet points
	- If you don't find enough related notes in those two subfolders, it's fine
## AI-assisted summary
- **!important** include summary only for notes longer than 1500 characters
	- if a note is longer than that create a section on top called `AI-assisted summary` with a concise summary of the main ideas
	  - Structure this summary into at least two paragraphs for better readability
	  - First paragraph should cover the core concept/main idea
	  - Second paragraph should expand on application, implications, or specific details
	  - Aim for 5-7 sentences length max, it should be like 8 lines of text at most
	  - then add horizontal line
  - if a note is shorter, ignore this
## Chunking
- For longer notes (over 500 characters), consider using the [[Chunking]] process to break them into more focused, interconnected notes
## Storage
- Inbox serves as the entrypoint to new knowledge
- **important workflow clarification** - Content type determines destination folder:
  1. **RAW materials** (book notes, interview transcripts, article summaries, attended lectures):
     - Store in `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW` following: `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[DAY]/[NOTE_TITLE].md`
     - Example: `04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/Book_Notes.md`
  2. **Knowledge nuggets** (concepts, principles, methods, insights):
     - Store directly in relevant subfolder of `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge` (typically under `3 - ðŸ“š Resources`)
     - Example: `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge/3 - ðŸ“š Resources/Development/Technical_Debt.md`
  3. Always enhance with proper metadata, tags, AI summary (if needed), and related notes
  4. Delete from Inbox folder after proper storage
# Typical information coming in
## Notes
- it is "passive" knowledge that I gathered somewhere
	- notes from books, articles, podcasts, attended lectures, conferences or classes
## Research artifacts
- Interview and workshop debriefs notes, post-mortems and learning
- Research plans, scripts and reports
## Serendipity moments
- "A-ha moments" in shower, toilet, while biking etc
- These are going to be pretty small
## Design artefacts
- prototypes, test results, boundary objects and results when doing some further research with them
## Reflections
- weekly or monthly recaps and learnings on what went well and what did not and maybe with some actionables
