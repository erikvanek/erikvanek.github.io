# MOC Maintenance

MOCs (Maps of Content) are living documents that provide conceptual maps of different knowledge areas. They should evolve organically as your knowledge grows.

## When to Update MOCs
- After processing several related notes
- When starting a new project that draws on existing knowledge
- During regular (monthly/quarterly) reviews
- When you notice a knowledge area has grown significantly

## Updating Process
1. Open the relevant MOC
2. Review recently added notes in that domain
3. Add important new notes to the appropriate sections
4. Consider restructuring if the MOC is growing unwieldy
5. Ensure bidirectional linking (notes should link back to the MOC)
6. Check for and update cross-MOC connections

## MOC Creation Guidelines
- Focus on creating Resource MOCs for now (in the 3 - ðŸ“š Resources folder)
- Create new MOCs when you have 5+ notes on a specific topic
- Keep MOCs focused on navigability rather than comprehensiveness
- Organize by relevance and importance, not alphabetically or chronologically
- Limit total links to 20-30 per MOC for clarity
- Use brief descriptions to provide context for each linked note
- Consider expanding to other PARA categories after evaluating their usefulness
