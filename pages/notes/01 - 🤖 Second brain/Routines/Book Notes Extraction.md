# Book Notes Knowledge Extraction

## Purpose
Extract valuable knowledge nuggets from processed book notes and integrate them into the knowledge base, creating connections between raw materials and existing knowledge structures.

## Process

### 1. Nugget Identification
- Extract 2-3 high-value insights from each book note
- Prioritize principles and concepts over specific examples
- Look for insights that:
  - Challenge conventional thinking
  - Provide frameworks for understanding
  - Offer actionable mental models
  - Complement existing knowledge

### 2. Knowledge Integration
- Identify existing knowledge nodes that could be enhanced by the nuggets
- Never modify RAW notes - treat them as read-only source material
- When adding to existing notes:
  - Integrate nuggets naturally into the text flow
  - Reference the source directly using wiki links: `as noted in [[path/to/book-note|Book Title]]`
  - Avoid creating separate heading sections labeled by source
  - Restructure content if needed for better flow and coherence

### 3. New Knowledge Creation
- Create new knowledge notes when a concept deserves dedicated exploration
- Place new notes in appropriate locations within Knowledge folder structure (usually `10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge/3 - ðŸ“š Resources/[Category]`)
- Structure new knowledge notes with:
  - Clear title and appropriate tags
  - Concise definition/explanation of the concept
  - Key principles drawn from source material
  - Application guidelines where relevant
  - Related concepts section prioritizing links to Knowledge folder notes

### 4. Connection Building
- Ensure bidirectional linking between:
  - Raw book notes and enhanced knowledge notes
  - New knowledge notes and related existing concepts
  - Between complementary concepts across the knowledge base
- Prioritize connections to notes in Knowledge folder over To-process or RAW folders

## Example
```
// Original text in Design.md
- Design is about making trade-offs

// Enhanced with book nugget
- Design is about making trade-offs, and as McDonough argues in [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2023/03/23/cradle-to-cradle|Cradle to Cradle]], "being less bad =/= being good" - reducing harm is not the same as creating positive impact
```
