Main goal of building this second brain is to be able to speed up new project executions by leveraging already gathered notes, reflections and to find new, unusual, connections between various data points in my knowledge base.

Aspiring goal is coming from Second brain theory - **_Start projects that are already 80 percent done_**.

Second brain follows [[Principles]] to ensure the knowledge can be trusted and is efficiently processed. [[01 - 🤖 Second brain/Backlog|Backlog]] lists topics I would like to address with my second brain efforts further.

The typical flow of information is like this:
1. Capture new knowledge, analzye it and enrich with metadata 
2. Process and expand existing knowledge base
3. Retrieve relevant information during new initiatives using [[01 - 🤖 Second brain/Routines/Knowledge Retrieval|AI-assisted Knowledge Retrieval]]
4. Rebalance knowledge base if it grows out of hand through [[01 - 🤖 Second brain/Routines/Knowledge Rebalancing|Knowledge Rebalancing]]

# Folder structure
## 00 - ⚙️ Processing
- can be used for interim AI-assisted processing during new information processing or when rebalancing knowledge base
## 01 - 🤖 Second brain
- instructions about how my second brain routines and processes should work
	- nested folder `Obsolete approach` includes information about previous structure, ignore it for now
## 02 - 📩 Inbox
- main entry point for new knowledge flowing into the second brain
- process described in [[Inbox processing]]
## 03 - 🗑️ Dump
- this can be results of research or stacked URLs that I can't process now but might be handy in future and I don't want to forget about them, but also don't want to clutter my devices with it
## 04 - 💽 RAW
- this is where raw notes are stored in a shape in which they got in, mainly through `📩 Inbox` folder - usually it passively generated notes by reading resources or attending events.
## 10 - 🧠 Knowledge
- this is the most important part of my knowledge base, it should be structured by the [[10 - 🧠 Knowledge/2 - 🌱 Areas/Continuous improvement/Second brain|Second brain]]'s `Para` methodology:
## 20 – ✨ Ephemeron
- processed notes related to `03 - 🗑️ Dump` folders, more info on this TBD
