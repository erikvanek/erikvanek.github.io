Key principles when using my second brain
# 1. Human-created input
Everything that comes through [[Processes]] is solely created or curated by [[Human in the loop]].
# 2. [[Human in the loop]]
AI helps in processing the knowledge base but human is in charge of deciding what is relevant and what is not for further usage.
# 3. English
I struggle with mixing English and Czech in my knowledge base. From now on it should be fully in English. Make sure the output of every new processing (also note names) is done in English.
# 4. AI-assisted processing
I want to leverage capabilities available by LLMs to help me with tagging and structuring information, taking care of things like [[Dump processing]] that are not super high priority but I want to have them at hand if needed
# 5. Store RAW, enrich existing
Make sure we store all notes as they come in RAW format so that they can be repurposed later if it is needed. Enrich existing knowledge base nuggets with most relevant pieces of information coming from new knowledge.
# 6. Keep it lean
Keep it lean while building this second brain. Restrain from over-engineering so that I can make use of it well rather than spending time on maintenance.
