- notes from [here](https://training.itcilo.org/delta/Foresight/3-Horizons.pdf)
- useful conceptual model to aid people thinking about current assumptions, emerging changes and possible & desired futures
- helps to think about potential changes in short/mid/long term and what impacts those might bring
- helps to generate innovation by challenging assumptions from different perspectives
- Horizons:
	- First
		- current context & conditions
		- the focus is on maintaining stability
	- Third
		- transformative emerging changes, thoughts about possible futures and visions of preferred futures
		- the focus is on transformation and disruption
	- Second
		- actions taken in the present to resist change, or to adapt to it or build on top of it
		- the focus is on creating and managing change
## Setup
- large room with one blank wall for a long wall mural
	- used for drawing three overlapping curves depicting the three horizons
	- wall should be long enough so that it's comfy for participants to play with post-its around
- ideally having 3 colors of post-its for each horizon
## The process
- Ask participants to work in pairs and each pair gets some pens & post-its
	- Horizon 1
		- 20-30 mins
		- Ask pairs to brainstorm as many answers to questions:
			- "What are current working assumptions about product, service, resource, staffu, customers"
			- "What is the current state of play?"
			- "What are managers taking for granted when making decisions?"
		- 15 mins brainstorming, then posting to the mural
		- 15 mins clustering, discussing
	- Horizon 3
		- 45 mins
		- identification of emerging trends representing transformational shifts from the present
		- Ask questions like:
			- "What changes are emerging as new paradigms?" 
			- "What new inventions has you worried or excited?"
			- "What are visionary leaders saying?"
		- 15 mins pair brainstorming
			- it is expected to have fewer ideas generated as talking about the future is not easy
				- a deck of 'change cards' can be useful to kickstart the ideation
				- those can be also then used by teams to post on mural
		- 15 mins reviewing the change deck cards, clustering & posting on the mural
		- 15 mins to review all the changes posted on the mural
	- Horizon 2
		- 45 mins
		- divide people into 4-6 sized tables
		- review assumptions from Horizon 1 & emerging issues from Horizon 3
		- the main question of this horizon is "What assumptions are challenged by those changes, and how can we respond to the resulting opportunities and risks?", i.e. more focused:
			- "Which assumptions will be most challenged by change?"
			- "Which are most vulnerable to these emerging changes?" 
			- "Are there any which are being strengthened?" Pick one highly vulnerable assumption.
			- "How can you use the emerging changes to create entirely new products, services and markets?"
			- "Is there another business model that could replace a challenged model? Other production process(es)? New sources in the supply chain? Emerging customer segments?"
		- Choose two to three emerging changes that could be used to build new models or processes
		- Each group use an interesting transition idea to successfully bridge from Horizon 1 to Horizon 3
	- Debrief
		- 15 mins
		- discussing key hightlights from the exercise
		- What current assumptions will be most challenged by change?
		- Will any become obsolete in the face of the changes weâ€™ve identified?
		- What changes offer the most promise and immediately actionable opportunities
		- Which innovations or initiatives hold the most promise?
