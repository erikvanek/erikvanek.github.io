- is the bare bone of [[Design research]]
- when developing research questions - think ahead of what will happen to answers - we receive since I know what comes next in the process after I have concluded it
	- i.e. don't do research just for the sake of doing research, think of how gathered [[Insight]]s help us to move forward in the next phase
	- ask a question __"How will the answer to this question help to generate a range of insights & ideas to create a new value?"__
- [[Research question]] is often vague at the beginning but it _gets precised_ over time
- helpful to come up with more to start with and then conclude with one
- should start with _"How"_
- clear, focused, and concise statement that conveys the objectives of the research and its potential findings
- Shoud meet [Finer](https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/research-process/finer-research-framework/) and [PICO](https://www.library.sydney.edu.au/support/searching/pico) criteria
- A good research question is specific, actionable, and practical:
	- 1. It is possible to answer the question using the techniques and methods available to you
	- 1. It’s possible (but not guaranteed) that you can arrive at an answer with a sufficient degree of confidence to base decisions on what you’ve learned
- Dive deep into ]framing research questions
- __Only _after_ you have identified your research questions can you select the best way to answer the question.__
	- first research question, then research plan and activities
- Research X Interview question
	- RQ - **How do families with school-age children decide how to spend money on vacations?**
	- IQ - **Walk me through your last vacation from planning it until when you arrived back home.**
- 4 main categories:
	- Generative/Exploratory: How will this activity yield the kind of deep understanding we seek?
	- Descriptive: How will this activity provide a detailed, truthful, and accurate picture of the situation or sequence of events?
		- Evaluative: How will this activity enable a reliable assessment based on a clear set of criteria?
	- Causal: How will this activity establish a cause and effect relationship, beyond simple correlation?
- 5 main characteristics:
	- **Feasible.** You need to have the resources and abilities to examine the question, collect the data, and give answers.
	- **Interesting.** Create research questions that offer fascinating insights into your industry.
	- **Novel.** Research questions have to offer something new within your field of study.
	- **Ethical.** The research question topic should be approved by the relevant authorities and review boards.
	- **Relevant.** Your research question should lead to visible changes in society or your industry.
	7 types of quali research questions:
	- [Explanatory research](https://dovetail.com/research/explanatory-research/) questions investigate particular topic areas that aren't well known.
	- **Contextual** research questions describe the workings of what is already in existence.
	- **Evaluative** research questions examine the effectiveness of specific paradigms or methods.
	- **Ideological** research questions aim to advance existing ideologies.
	- **Descriptive** research questions describe an event.
	- [Generative research](https://dovetail.com/ux/generative-research/) questions help develop actions and theories by providing new ideas.
	- **Emancipatory** research questions increase social action engagement, usually to benefit disadvantaged people.
