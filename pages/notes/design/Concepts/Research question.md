- is the bare bone of [[Design research]]
- when developing research questions - think ahead of what will happen to answers - we receive since I know what comes next in the process after I have concluded it
	- i.e. don't do research just for the sake of doing research, think of how gathered [[Insight]]s help us to move forward in the next phase
	- ask a question __"How will the answer to this question help to generate a range of insights & ideas to create a new value?"__
- [[Research question]] is often vague at the beginning but it _gets precised_ over time
- helpful to come up with more to start with and then conclude with one
- should start with _"How"_
- clear, focused, and concise statement that conveys the objectives of the research and its potential findings
