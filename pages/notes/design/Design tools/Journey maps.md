- visualize the experience of a person over time
- help to find gaps in CX & explore potential solutions
- structured as a series of steps
	- events, moments, experiences, interactions
- usually have various scales to represent different aspects of one experience i.e different zoom levels
- they help make "intangible" XPs visible and facilitate common understanding
- can be assumption or research based
- types
	- current state
		- looks to find problems or improvements in current service
	- future state
		- helps to imagine yet to be made service
- focus
	- product centered
		- map containing only touchpoints
			- steps representing an interaction between a customer & the product
			- everything out of the company is hidden
			- e.g. useful for mapping onboarding
			- might miss important contextual info e.g. signing up for new electricity provider might miss the stress of people moving houses
	- XP centered
		- reflect situational context and show how are touchpoints embedded in overall XP
		- sidenote - often using a service is not the goal of the user, the goal is to achieve the goal e.g. having electricity is the goal, signing up is the chore
		- often the design challenge shifts like from "What is the onboarding XP of our electricity provider" into "What is the XP of moving houses & where does electricity provider swap fits it"
- product-centered is often zoomed in deeper than XP centered
