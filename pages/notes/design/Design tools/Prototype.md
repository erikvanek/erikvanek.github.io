- __"The best way to have an idea is to have a lot of ideas"__
- a tool of self-expression & to help understand each other better
- _never have only one prototype_
	- they are mentioned to fail & you should learn from those failures
- prepared to explore, evaluate & communicate ideas within the [[Service design]] process
- can be focused holistically or for individual step
- set up & built so that we can learn from them later
- replace actual implementation to learn faster & the aim is to __maximize learning__ (because they are cheap to change / throw away)
- [[Prototype]] is for [[Service design]] what learning is for humans
- Act of creating and using [[Prototype]] is called [[Prototyping]]
- We're also using tools and techniques from [[Interaction design]]
- usually framed as a conceptual model
	- that is the actual interface people interact with
	- should be aligned with mental models of what [[Humans]] have in mind
## Types
[[Actions, processes & experiences prototype]]
[[Physical prototypes]]
[[Environment, spaces & architecture prototypes]]
[[Digital & SW prototypes]]
[[Ecosystem & business value prototypes]]
