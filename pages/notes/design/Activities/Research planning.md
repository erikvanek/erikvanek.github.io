## Research planning
- includes research loops, sample size & selection & [[Design methods]] selection
- _research loops are a tool to iterate_
- don't forget about [[Triangulation]]
- when deciding sample selection - beware of research bias
- _emergent sampling_
	- follow new leads during fieldwork as they unfold, leverage flexibly new knowledge
	- i.e. when you find something interesting, don't ignore it
- beware of research context
	- e.g. when researching train station service
		- what kind of people you need at train station during different day times
- it us useful to engage with participants in their natural surroundings
- when more research only confirms already identified patterns, [theoretical saturation is reached](https://dovetail.com/research/data-saturation/), then it is possible to [iterate](https://medium.com/idinsight-blog/the-case-for-iteration-in-qualitative-research-design-e07ed1314756)
- research types
	- overt
		- you are open with your intent
		- inherently biased with "the observer effect"
	- covert
		- your intent is hidden
		- ethically problematic
- a good method mix combines each of:
	- [[Desk research]]
		- before or in parallel - try to go through some [[Secondary research]]
	- [[Self-ethnographic research]]
	- [[Ethnographic methods]]
	- [[Participant approach]]
		- interviews, observation, focus groups
	- Non-participant approaches
		- non-participant observation, cultural probes, co-creating
	- Co-creative workshops
		- journey maps, system maps, co-creating personas
