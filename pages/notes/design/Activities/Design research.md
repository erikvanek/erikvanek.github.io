- __to understand people & their behavior related to the product or service__
- enables to _empathize_ & get to know the context
- is *"Becoming friends with reality"* - Erika Hall
- motivation to find out how customers or other relevant actors experience a given service
- helps to move beyond assumptions
- two main types:
	- qualitative
		- answers the question "Why?"
	- quantitative
		- answers the question "How?"
- __starts with a [[Research question]] and aims to derive [[Insight]]s__
- usually is based on ethnographic methods
- typical process:
	- research scope & planning -> data collection -> synthesis -> key [[Insight]]s
- gives us:
	- customer problems & needs
	- experience gaps
	- testing & feedback collection
- outcomes should be _clear & understandable to the whole team_
- use [[Triangulation]] - allows to have more & better [[Prototype]]s
- starts with [[Research planning]]
- results should be visualized by [[Research Visualization]]
- "CX oriented research is rather inductive (finding out along the way), whereas testing prototypes is deductive (validating hypothesis)"
- Important to take notes [well][https://condens.io/user-research-note-taking/]
- **The mismatches between user attitudes and user actions are often a great source of insights**.
- Two main fidelities
	- pure - rigorous research uncovering completely new knowledge 
	- applied - less rigorous, borrows ideas and techniques from pure research but is more relaxed
- Research can be also looked through the [double diamond](https://dovetail.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right/) paradigm
