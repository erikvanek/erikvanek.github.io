- A systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data from qualitative research
- A rule of thumb - _Analysis can be a lengthy process - budget at least as much time as you had for the data collection to complete it_
- Qualitative data -> Codes -> Themes
- Code
	- a word or phrase that acts as a labe for a segment of text
	- a shorthand for more complicated information
	- types:
		- Descriptive
			- They describe what the data is about
		- Interpretive
			- Analytical reading of the data, adding researcher's interpretation
- Coding
	- process of labeling segments of text with appropriate codes
- Process in 6 steps:
	- gather your data
	- read all your date from beginning to end
	- code the data
	- create codes that encapsulate potential themes
	- take a break :)
	- re-evaluate identified themes and return to step 4 if needed
