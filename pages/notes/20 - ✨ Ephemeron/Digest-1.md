## Welcome to Ephemeron

This is Ephemeron issue vol. 1 – your weekly distillation of design brilliance, AI breakthroughs, and leadership wisdom. Today's issue explores the fascinating intersection of emotional impact in UX, the transformative power of AI in learning design, and the art of conscious leadership.

Dive into Swiss passport design that turns security features into art, discover how Duolingo created 148 AI-generated language courses in just one year, and explore Jerry Colonna's radical self-inquiry approach that's reshaping leadership development. Plus, we've rounded up the latest product updates from Anthropic, Luma, and Replit, along with the most intriguing European design events coming your way this spring.

Ready for a 10-minute journey through the ideas and innovations shaping our creative landscape? Let's begin.

## Design Insights

### The Beautiful World of UX (Smashing Magazine)
**"In times when we try to optimize and automate everything, there is one fine detail that we overlook: the power of emotional impact. The impact of empathy, and the power of truly magical user experience."** Smashing Magazine's newsletter highlights the beautiful world of UX and design with examples ranging from Swiss passport design to 3D data visualization.

### Swiss Passport Design
**"The new Swiss passport introduced in 2022 is such a shining design star."** Created by Geneva-based design studio RETINAA, the passport honors Swiss graphic arts tradition by depicting 3D-modeled landscapes, taking you on an imaginary journey along Switzerland's watercourses from Alpine peaks to valleys. Security features include contour lines revealing the country's topography and cultural landmarks under ultraviolet light – a breathtaking example of functional design with aesthetic excellence.

### 3D Data Visualization for NBA Games
**"It's probably no exaggeration to say that data visualization is an art."** Vinicius Sueiro's "Hoop Hills" project showcases a 3D interactive data visualization that looks like a hilly landscape to explore NBA game data. You can select the team, opponent, season, kind of game, period, and game result to see when teams were leading or trailing. The visualization can be turned and tilted in all directions for different perspectives.

### Quiet Hours for Inclusive Retail
**"Bright lights, loud music, bustling crowds — all these things can turn shopping into a stressful rather than an enjoyable experience."** Retailers are implementing "quiet hours" to make shopping more accessible, particularly for disabled and neurodivergent people. Sephora UK recently announced quiet hours twice a week where they turn down music, dim screens, and let shoppers browse peacefully. As Kelly Chan points out, "this move isn't just about accessibility, it's about empathy, inclusion, and the future of retail."

## AI Development

### Duolingo's AI Revolution in Instructional Design
**"Duolingo announced an unprecedented expansion: 148 new language courses created using generative AI, effectively doubling their content library in just one year."** This process previously took the company 12 years for their first 100 courses. Duolingo's Birdbrain AI system has transformed instructional design through three critical shifts:
- Role transformation: Human IDs are evolving from content creators to AI orchestrators and quality guardians
- Process acceleration: What once took years now takes months, with AI handling scale while humans ensure quality
- Evaluation revolution: Continuous, real-time assessment is replacing traditional episodic evaluation

### Netflix's Foundation Models for Recommendations
**"Netflix recently adopted foundation models in a completely new domain: to create a personal recommendation system architecture that assimilates information both from members' interaction histories and Netflix's content."** Borrowing insights from Large Language Models (LLMs), the new recommendation system aims to harness the vast data of over 300 million users' interactions - hundreds of billions of interactions, a dataset comparable to the token volume of LLMs.

### AI-First Company Culture
**"What do Shopify, Duolingo, Fiverr, and Google have in common? They're all eager to be thought of as AI-First companies."** Cassie Kozyrkov, former Chief Decision Scientist at Google, shares insights on implementing "AI-First" company culture. Her approach focuses on two attitudes:
- "How could I do this better?" - Using AI to improve work processes and get advice
- "Can we scale the impossible?" - Rethinking what's possible with AI automation
She emphasizes that AI-First doesn't mean AI-for-AI's-sake, but rather strategic implementation that brings real value.

## Leadership & Team Development

### Jerry Colonna on Radical Self-Inquiry
**"How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?"** Executive coach Jerry Colonna shares powerful insights on leadership development. His approach combines practical leadership skills + radical self-inquiry + shared experiences to enhance leadership and resilience. Colonna highlights that team dysfunction often stems from unresolved personal issues, making self-awareness crucial for effective leadership.

### The Consciousness Hack for Success
**"The path to success without misery is consciousness—understanding your true motivations rather than following socialized patterns that lead to achievement without fulfillment."** Colonna encourages breakthrough questions like "What am I not saying that I need to say?" and "What's being said that I'm not hearing?" to foster more authentic leadership.
