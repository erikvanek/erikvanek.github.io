# Newsletter Digest #1: May 1 - May 8, 2025

## AI-assisted summary

This is a sample digest to demonstrate the format and structure. In an actual implementation, this digest would only contain real content from your newsletter subscriptions and labeled emails, not fabricated information.

* **This digest serves as a template** for how future digests will be structured and formatted

* **Actual digests will strictly include only content** from your labeled emails in Gmail

* **No information will be fabricated** - all articles, updates, and events will come directly from your inbox

* **Conference listings will prioritize European events** that actually appear in your newsletters

* **The agent will add the "claude-digested" label** to all processed emails for tracking

## Note About This Sample

This is a demonstration digest that shows the format and structure that will be used when processing your actual newsletter subscriptions. When you run the agent with real data, it will:

1. Search your Gmail for emails with the labels "Blogs," "Product updates," and "Konference"
2. Extract and summarize the actual content from those emails
3. Format the content with the structure shown here
4. Only include real information that exists in your inbox

In a real digest, each section would contain actual newsletter content rather than placeholder text. The agent will never fabricate information and will only report on content that genuinely exists in your labeled emails.

To generate your first real digest, use:
```
claude, create a digest from my newsletter subscriptions since [date]
```

## Upcoming Conferences & Events

The actual implementation will only include real conference information from your "Konference" labeled emails, with a focus on European in-person events.
