- can be [[Selective coding]], [[Axial coding]], [[Open coding]] or [[Closed coding]]
	- usually a mix of them
	- more niche - focused coding, theoretical coding, thematic coding, ...
- _a process of systematically identifying, categorizing and labeling important ideas with appropriate codes_
- can be useful to establish a [[Codebook]]
- it helps to find human stories behind the data
- the process varies depending on a research goal
## Code selection
- review the research question to ensure the codes suit it
- identify key concepts and phenomena relevant to the research question
- conduct a preliminary data review to identify initial themes and topics
- define initial code structure to suit the research goal while allowing new to codes to be added along the way
- apply initial framework to the data
- modify (add, merge, split, ...) as you go based on project needs
- ensure consistency
## Coding steps
- first round pass of coding
- organize codes into categories and subcodes
- do further rounds of coding - reanalyzing, finding patterns
- turn codes and findings into final narrative
- slowly reducing the number of codes and narratives emerging
- 
## Best prectices
- use a [[Codebook]] to keep track of codes
- capture positive and negative aspects of a phenomena
## Code
- represents data like a keyword represents an article
- a word or phrase that acts as a lable for a segment of text
	- a shorthand for more complicated information
	- types:
		- Descriptive
			- They describe what the data is about
		- Interpretive
			- Analytical reading of the data, adding researcher's interpretation
