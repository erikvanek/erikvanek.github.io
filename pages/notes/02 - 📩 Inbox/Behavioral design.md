# Behavioral Design

- Nice patterns in [Coglode cookbook](https://www.coglode.com/)
- Intro to [behavior science](https://insights.aimforbehavior.com/p/a-short-introduction-to-behavioral)
- Connects design with insights from behavioral science, economy and psychology to **directly affect the behavior of users or customers**
- key principle is that human beings do not act rationally, but often act based on unconscious processes, behavioral principles or biases
- aims to minimize friction during the actual experience
	- e.g. Netflix autoplay, Duolingo's gamification or loss aversion (losing a hot streak)
- A [manifesto for applying behavioral science](https://www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BIT_Manifesto.pdf) looks into the future of behavior science

## Behavioral Design Experimentation (from [[DESB42_Designove_experimenty|DESB42: Designové experimenty]])
- **Testing nudges**: Experiments with subtle design elements that guide user behavior without restricting choices
- **Default option testing**: Evaluating how different preset options influence decision-making
- **Call-to-action variations**: Testing different formulations of messages and prompts
- **Ethical considerations**:
  - Informed consent of research participants
  - Data privacy protection
  - Consideration of potential negative impacts
  - Transparency about data collection and use
# Frameworks
## COM-B
- to achieve desired behavior, users need to have three resources at their disposal
- these three resources are affecting each other
**B = C + O + M**
B = behavior
C = capability
O = opportunity
M = motivation
### Example
- **B** - We want the user to read the newsletter
- **C** - Newsletter is readable and easy to digest
- **O** - Newsletter arrives when the users has time and space to read it
- **M** - Newsletter contains information that is interesting to the user
## EAST
- in order to influence a behavior, we should make sure we design the experience for the user so it is:
- **EAST**
	- **E** – easy to minimize barriers and friction
	- **A** – attractive – interesting and visually appealing
	- **S** – social – using social norms and surrounding influence
	- **T** – timely – appropriate timing of our intervention

## Hook model
- by Nir Eyal
- my notes from the book [[11 - ⏳ interim knowledge/Design/Books/Hooked|Hooked]]
- Building addictive products comes in 4 steps:
	- **Trigger**
		- external (notification) or internal (boredom)
	- **Action**
		- simple user action induced by the trigger
	- **Variable reward**
		- unpredictable reward that changes in time (amount of likes, ...)
	- **Investment**
		- user invests time or energy which increases the chance of returning to the product or service (IKEA effect)
