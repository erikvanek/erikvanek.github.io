- Principles are not that helpful compared to tenets
- Tenets are more bold and help guide the product way better
- Tenets are more like decision making tools that the team can return to when facing a difficult decision
- When constructing them â€“ try to look for places where teams return to often, figure it out for once and then codify them
- Example from Apple when making Keynote:
	1. It should be difficult to make ugly presentations
	2. Focus on cinematic quality transitions
	3. Optimize for innovation over powerpoint compatibility
