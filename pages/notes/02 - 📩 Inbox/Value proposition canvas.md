- "It's a map that becomes clearer once you get to know your customer better"
- It allows us to visualize how we intend to solve our customers' problems by mapping out what their needs are together with what we're offering
- It helps to better find a product-market or product-solution fit
- typically product teams create multiple canvases for different types of customers
- value proposition canvas is primarily a business strategy tool
- composed of two parts
	- customer profile
		- used to define customer profiles
		- describe [[JTBD]]
			- functional (getting from A-B)
				- specific tasks that have practical benefits
			- social (impressing friends)
				- are how customers want others to [perceive](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/perception "What is Perception in UX/UI Design?") them and their desire to fit into or stand out within their social circles
			- emotional (gaining piece of mind)
				- cater to the feelings and emotional states that customers wish to achieve when using a product
		- highlight pains that prevent to get their job done
			- frustrations, obstacles and what gets them annoyed to get their job done
			- pains and negative outcomes customers want to avoid
		- gains
			- describe how we customers measure the success of the job was well done
			- positive outcomes customers hope to achieve like concrete results, benefits and even aspirations
			- represent the outcomes and benefits your customers want, and that would give them moments of delight
			- they are not the simple result of a job
			- aren’t just the inverse of pains
				- For example, if a pain is “What if I don't learn anything new?” a gain isn’t “Learning something new.” Instead, a gain would be “Educational materials tailored to my level of knowledge and career stage.”
	- value map
		- with it, you **list products and services your value proposition builds on**
			-  **If a business tries to address every customer job, pain and gain, they will likely do it poorly**
			- Products can be:
				- Tangible (e.g., a physical product, an in-person service).
				- Digital (e.g., an application, an online course).
				- Intangible (e.g., consulting services).
		- pain relievers describe how they mitigate customer pains and make their lives easier
		- gain creators outline how they produce increase and maximize outcomes and benefits your customers expect, desire or would be surprised by
- **you achieve fit when you create clear connection between what matters to customer and how your products, services and features ease pains and create gains**
- great value propositions target essential customer jobs, pains and gains and do so extremely well
## Value proposition statement
- value proposition is a statement or short paragraph that
	- Clearly describes what a service, business or organization offers.
	- Who benefits from it.
	- Why it is beneficial to those people.
