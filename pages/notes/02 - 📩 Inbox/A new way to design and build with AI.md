- Lovable is the fastest growing startup in european history
- The biggest enabler is talking to users and customers on repeat - constant learning about the users, the market
	- **designers (or anyone having a research skills) have such a superpower** - the fact that we know how to research people helps us achieve our goals
- Don't fall in love in your ideas as they are going to be wrong and **be willing to be wrong**
- It can be a tectonic shift in digital product workflows and techniques and if code become a source of truth - it changes the game massively compared to Figma being in center
- Lovable is preparing integration of MCP
- Design process big to small
	- hierarchy first, information within that and then content design and then lay it out
	- trying to ask big questions first
	- depending on the feature - if it's related to layout I reach out to figma, if it's interactive I go for Loveable
- when vibe-prompting - try to **treat AI as a creative partner during jam session** and you can act more like a design director eventually with contextual prompts like `make it more like art-deco meets Wes Anderson` that might help explore different visual and content forms you would not think of by yourself
