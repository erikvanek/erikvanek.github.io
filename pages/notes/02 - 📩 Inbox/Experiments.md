	- the process of (dis)proving hypotheses – **Operationalization**
- Can be constructed with the help of [[Hypothesis]]
- Contradictory to [[Research-MOC]] – experiment has a clearly defined hypothesis
- Typically compares two or more variants and systematically watches differences between them
# Types
- Customer interviews
- Card sorting
- A/B/n testing
- Fake-door tests
# Example
**Problem**
- Orientation in a hospital
**Hypothesis**
- New set of pictograms speeds up the navigation process
**Metrics**
- walkthrough time
- content understanding
# Participant counts
- formative testing (finding problems, ...)
	- 5-8 should be fine
- comparing alternatives
	- 15-30 per group
	- more for A/B/n tests
