- various risk taxonomies
- good product teams tackle [big risks first](https://www.svpg.com/beyond-lean-and-agile/), especially the value risk
- the one used by SVPG
	- **value** risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)
		- the biggest risk of all
	- _business viability_ risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)
		- second most important because if not tackled then the org bleeds out
	- _usability_ risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)
	- _feasibility_ risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills and technology we have)
- the one developed by IDEO
	- _desirability_ (combines customer value and usability)
	- _viability_ 
	- _feasibility_
