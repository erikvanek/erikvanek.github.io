	- The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.
		- **Psychological safety:** A strong team culture was correlated with each member’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.
		- **Dependability:** On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time (vs the opposite - shirking responsibilities).
		- **Structure and clarity:** An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one’s performance are important for team effectiveness.
