- A technique described in a book **Continuous discovery habits**
- Consists of **layers**
	1. **Desired outcome**
		- What we want to achieve
		- Business outcomes measure the health of the business and are typically financial metrics like grow revenue, increase market share, or reduce churn
		- Product outcomes typically measure a customer behavior in the product or a customer sentiment about the product.
	2. **Opportunity**
		- Opportunity is an unmet customer need, pain point, or desire
		- Opportunities expose gaps in the market where we can immediately create value for our customers
		- Opportunities include needs, pain points, and desires
	3. **Solution**
		- A solution is a product, a service, or a feature that we offer to address an opportunity. The opportunity represents the underlying need, pain point, or desire.
		- E.g. for opportunity *- I’m hungry.* we have solutions:
			- Order takeout
			- Go out to eat at a local restaurant
			- Subscribe to a meal prep service
	4. **[[Experiments]]**
		- The best way to evaluate solutions is through [assumption testing](https://www.producttalk.org/2023/10/assumption-testing/). When we test the assumptions that our ideas depend upon, we collect the compare and contrast data we need to make a better decision.
# Principles
- The best way to test if an opportunity is really a solution in disguise is to ask, *'Is there more than one way to address this opportunity'*?
