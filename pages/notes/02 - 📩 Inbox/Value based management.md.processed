- Value-based management (VBM) provides a precise and unambiguous metric—value—upon which an entire organization can be built.
- **The value of a company is determined by its discounted future cash flows. Value is created only when companies invest capital at returns that exceed the cost of that capital.**
- The focus of VBM should not be on methodology. It should be on the why and how of changing your corporate culture.
- **Traditional financial performance measures, such as earnings or earnings growth, are not always good proxies for value creation**
	- To focus more directly on creating value, companies should set goals in terms of discounted cash flow value, the most direct measure of value creation.
- We strongly believe that value is the only correct criterion of performance.
- for VBM to stick, it must eventually involve every decision maker in the company like with every change management initiative
## Value drivers
- **performance variables** that will actually create the value of the business
- it is through these drivers of value that senior management learns to understand the rest of the organization and to establish a dialogue about what it expects to be accomplished
- **A value driver is any variable that affects the value of the company**
- Key value drivers are not static; they must be regularly reviewed
- To be useful, however, value drivers need to be organized so that managers can identify which have the greatest impact on value
- **ROIC trees** as a tool to illustrate company value drivers hierarchy
- usually divided into 3 levels
	- **generic**
		- operating margins and invested capital are combined to compute ROIC
	- **business unit**
		- variables such as customer mix are particularly relevant
	- **grass roots**
		- value drivers are precisely defined and tied to specific decisions that front-line managers have under their control
