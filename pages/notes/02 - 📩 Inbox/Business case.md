	- There is so much bad advice out there about how to make a business case for design. If I could tell designers one thing at the start of their career, it would be this: people make decisions based on their feelings and beliefs and then look for a rationale to back it up. Even and especially big financial decisions.  
	- Design is storytelling. (Get the Ellen Lupton book if you don't have it already.) The assumption that managers and business leaders make rational decisions based on quantitative analysis ends up making designers worse at storytelling, and then often sad and confused that the business case didn't work. There is no magic formula or metric that will get people to value something they don't already value, or aren't incentivized to value.  
	- This assumption that managers think differently from all other humans comes from economics and the way that classical economics continues to influence management theory and policy.  
	- Economists literally made up a guy, Homo economicus. This is a rational, narrowly self-interested agent who maximizes utility. Does not exist. Totally made up. Less basis in reality than most characters out of literature.  
	- Economists tell stories, that they call theories, in graphs. It's useful to consider classical economics as a subfield of graphic design. The fact that they use Calculus instead of Figma is immaterial. Supply side economics gained credence because of a diagram that Arthur Laffer drew on a napkin when he was having lunch with Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (the Laffer curve). Because it was a story expressed in math, that aligned with pre-existing beliefs of powerful people, it was taken far too seriously for too long.  
	- The lesson is to learn about people, and learn to trust your understanding of what people value and why. Don't assume that anyone wielding large numbers or complex formulae is more correct about anything beyond what they can actually measure, especially when they are making predictions.
