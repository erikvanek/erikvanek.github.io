# Monthly
- once a month
	- what are activities I'm involved in?
	- what are their priorities?
	- roughly how much time they take?
	- write them down on a piece of paper
	- assign 1hour blocks for next month planning and review
	- check weekly planning and review if needs to be adjusted
	- write a plan of what I expect to achieve in next month and review at the end of it

### Planning
- check monthly plan
- check last week plan and what did not work out
	- do I want to drag it on?
- inspired by [Cal](https://calnewport.com/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/)
- go through the list of previous lessons learnt and inspire and learn from them
- Go through sorted Inbox by date in Todoist and stuff urgent things into schedule 
### Review
- assign 1h blocks for weekly plans and review next week
- go through weekly plan and mark what worked and what happened and what did not
- review successes and failures
- create with [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0) and action items
- go through delayed todos and either put them to plan for next week or drop to todoist
- add things to plan for next week
- add things for next month plan if needed
- can I get more inspired by [Todoist's](https://www.todoist.com/cs/productivity-methods/weekly-review)?
# Daily
- inspiration from [todoist](https://www.todoist.com/cs/inspiration/end-work-day)
- shutdown 15 minutes
	- clean table
	- close all tabs
	- go through todos (this does not work – where to track new todos? weekly review?)
		- from todoist or reamarkable
		- unresolved tasks and add them where they belong
	- go through
		- daily successes
		- daily failures
		- note significant ones to the weekly review
	- review my weekly plan and maybe edit it a bit
	- review calendar for next 2 weeks
	- fill in all relevant timesheets
	- prepare the frog to eat in the morning for tomorrow
