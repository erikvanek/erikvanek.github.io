# Maintenance Supervisor Interview Reflection

## Interview Context
- **Date**: April 2, 2025
- **Interviewee Role**: Maintenance Supervisor
- **Interview Purpose**: Product discovery for AI implementation in manufacturing

## Key Reflection Points

### 1. Most Valuable Insights
Insights about the bridge between old and young generations of maintenance workers. Observed lack of trust in digital tools compared to sensory inputs from skilled workers. Workers gather insights for their day-to-day from companies that provide them material resources (e.g., "Be careful about this as this happens to our other clients...").

### 2. Effective Questions
Questions that asked the interviewee to recall a specific example in the near past were most effective.

### 3. Interview Dynamic
It was extremely difficult to manage the flow as the interviewee diverged frequently from questions. One of the most challenging interviews conducted as I needed to overtake the monologue at times to get necessary information. He was sharing a lot, which made steering the interview difficult.

### 4. Personal Reflection
Possible bias towards the interviewee's macho-like personality which I don't personally like.

### 5. Actionable Takeaways
A maintenance supervisor's day is quite variable. There's a mindset of "things are not as good as they used to be" in this field, especially in the older generation.

## Next Steps
Improve techniques for managing verbose interviewees while still collecting necessary data.
