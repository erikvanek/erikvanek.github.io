# Product Vision

## Introduction
A product vision articulates the desired future state that a product aims to create. It serves as a north star for product teams, aligning efforts and inspiring action. This note explores what makes an effective product vision and how to craft one.

## Core Characteristics of Effective Product Visions

### Persuasive Power
- A good product vision is fundamentally a _persuasion tool_
- It must convince stakeholders, team members, and users of the value and possibility of a future state
- Effective visions create emotional buy-in, not just intellectual agreement

### Emotional Impact
- "When done well, the product vision is _compelling_, _inspiring_, and _empowering_"
- It should leave product teams feeling excited to begin the hard work of making the vision a reality
- Creates a shared sense of purpose and meaning

### Memorable and Concrete
- A good vision is thought-provoking, inspiring, memorable and concrete
- Simple enough to be remembered and repeated
- Specific enough to guide decision-making

## Notable Examples

### Google's Early Vision
- "Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"
- Concise yet comprehensive
- Provides clear direction while remaining flexible for implementation

### Restructuring Priorities Example
- [Josh Miller's announcement](https://x.com/joshm/status/1850717644779110643) about putting Arc on ice demonstrates vision-driven prioritization
- The [new vision of Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/) shows how product direction can evolve

### Manifestos as Visions
- Manifestos often serve as powerful product visions
- They articulate core principles and desired outcomes
- Examples include the Agile Manifesto, which transformed software development

## Creating an Effective Product Vision

### Key Components
1. **Problem Statement**: What challenge are you addressing?
2. **User Focus**: Who benefits from your solution?
3. **Value Proposition**: What unique value do you provide?
4. **Future State**: What does the world look like when you succeed?
5. **Differentiation**: How is this different from what exists today?

### Vision Development Process
1. Research the problem space and user needs
2. Articulate multiple potential futures
3. Test vision statements with stakeholders
4. Refine based on feedback
5. Communicate consistently and with conviction

### Vision vs. Mission
- Vision describes the future you want to create
- Mission describes how you'll get there
- Both are needed but serve different purposes

## Applications

### Using Vision to Guide Product Strategy
- Evaluate feature ideas against the vision
- Prioritize initiatives that directly advance the vision
- Make tradeoffs based on vision alignment

### Communicating Vision to Different Audiences
- For executives: Focus on business impact and differentiation
- For developers: Emphasize technical challenges and innovation
- For users: Highlight benefits and experience improvements

### Vision Validation
- Test vision with users and stakeholders
- Look for emotional resonance and understanding
- Refine the articulation if it's not landing as intended
