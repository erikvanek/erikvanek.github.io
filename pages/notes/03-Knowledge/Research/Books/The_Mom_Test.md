# The Mom Test

## Book Overview
"The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick is a practical guide to conducting effective customer conversations. It teaches how to ask good questions that even your mother couldn't lie to you about, helping you get honest feedback about your ideas and avoid misleading validation.

## Key Concepts

### The Mom Test Defined
The Mom Test is a set of rules for crafting questions that elicit honest, useful feedback - even when people are trying to be nice (like your mom would be about your business idea).

### Core Principles
1. Talk about their life, not your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future
3. Listen more, talk less

## Interview Techniques

### Effective Questions
- "Talk me through the last time you encountered [problem X]"
- "What are you currently doing to solve [problem X]?"
- "How much time/money does this problem cost you?"
- "What else have you tried?"

### Questions to Avoid
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- "Would you buy a product that does X?"
- "How much would you pay for X?"

### Spotting Bad Data
- **Compliments**: Generic positive feedback without specifics
- **Fluff**: Hypothetical statements using words like "would," "could," "might"
- **Ideas**: When customers start pitching solutions rather than describing problems

## Customer Signals

### Commitment Currencies
Three ways customers show genuine interest:
- **Time**: Willingness to spend meaningful time with you
- **Reputation Risk**: Introducing you to others
- **Money**: Actual financial investment

### Strong Commitment Signals
- "This is the worst part of my life, and you can help me fix it"
- Introducing you to key stakeholders without prompting
- Offering to pay for an early version that doesn't exist yet

### Warning Signs
- Not getting introduced to other stakeholders
- Lack of concrete next steps or decision points

## Practical Application

### The Three Most Important Things
Before each interview, decide the three most important things you want to learn

### Learning from Emotional Responses
- Look for people expressing deep emotion about problems - they're often your best prospects
- Pay attention to body language, tone, and intensity of response

### Interview Sequence
1. Frame the conversation (not a sales pitch)
2. Ask about specific past experiences
3. Explore current solutions and workarounds
4. Dig into details and metrics
5. Document and analyze immediately after
