# Design Crit

## Overview
Design critique (or "design crit") is a structured technique for reviewing design proposals and providing constructive feedback. It's a collaborative process aimed at improving design outcomes through thoughtful evaluation and discussion.

## Key Elements

### Optimal Structure
- Ideal size is around 7 participants to balance breadth and depth of feedback
- Should include diverse perspectives but remain focused
- Schedule early in the design process before designers become too attached to solutions
- Share work early and often to prevent becoming overly invested in particular solutions

### Types of Design Crits

#### Standard Critique
- Designer presents work with context and specific feedback requests
- Participants provide targeted feedback on design decisions and effectiveness

#### No-Context Critique
- Work is presented without explanatory context
- Rationale: If users can't understand the design without explanation, it may need refinement
- Tests intuitive understanding of the design
- Can reveal assumptions that designers have made

### Effective Critique Questions
- "Why do you think this particular solution solves the problem better than alternatives?"
- "What user needs does this address?"
- "How does this align with our design principles?"
- "What tradeoffs were considered?"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Treating critique as a "liking game" or popularity contest
- Focusing on personal preferences rather than objective effectiveness
- Using voting mechanisms without substantive discussion
- Vague or subjective comments without actionable feedback

## Best Practices

### For Organizers
- Set clear guidelines and expectations
- Establish a safe, constructive environment
- Keep sessions focused on improving the work
- Encourage specific, actionable feedback

### For Designers
- Come prepared with specific questions
- Be open to feedback without becoming defensive
- Take notes on key insights
- Clarify feedback that seems unclear

### For Participants
- Focus on the design, not the designer
- Frame feedback constructively
- Support observations with reasoning
- Offer alternatives when identifying issues

## Application
- Use in both early conceptual phases and more refined design stages
- Can be formal scheduled sessions or informal desk critiques
- Adapt format based on project needs and timeline
