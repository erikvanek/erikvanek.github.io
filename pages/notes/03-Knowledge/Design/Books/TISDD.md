# This is Service Design Doing: Prototyping & Process

## Book Overview
"This is Service Design Doing" provides practical guidance on service design methodologies, tools, and implementation. The book emphasizes hands-on approaches to designing services that work for real people in real situations. This note focuses primarily on the prototyping methodologies and service design process outlined in the book.

## Service Design Process

### Core Framework
The service design process follows a general structure of:
1. **Research** → 
2. **Ideation** → 
3. **Prototyping** → 
4. **Piloting** → 
5. **Implementation**

### Value Creation Framework
Service design balances three key dimensions in what the authors call the Value Triangle:
- **Desirability** - What customers want and need
- **Feasibility** - What is technically and organizationally possible
- **Viability** - What is financially sustainable

These dimensions interact through:
- **Intentions** - The strategic goals and planned outcomes
- **Interactions** - The tactical touchpoints and experiences

### Research Approach
- Focus on understanding user needs through contextual inquiry
- Makes visible what other companies with similar approaches have already done
- Emphasis on finding unmet needs and generating insights
- Methods include:
  - Customer journey shadowing
  - Contextual interviews
  - Observation of existing processes

## Prototyping Methodology

### Core Principles

#### Purpose of Prototyping
Prototyping serves three main purposes:
1. **Exploratory** - To explore new options and future solutions
   - Often done for internal team consumption
   - Functions as "ideation at work"
   - Focuses on divergent thinking

2. **Evaluative** - To test how people experience proposed solutions
   - Helps the team converge on promising directions
   - Includes testing specific hypotheses
   - Clarifies priorities and focus areas

3. **Communicative** - To explain concepts to specific audiences
   - Tailored to particular stakeholders
   - Reduces misunderstandings
   - Kickstarts meaningful discussions
   - Should minimize friction

#### Economic Principle
"The best prototype is the one that in its simplest way makes the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable."

#### Benefits of Prototyping
- Reduces uncertainty and risk
- Identifies and explores alternative solutions
- Creates shared understanding of ideas and concepts
- Uncovers new questions for research
- Reduces bias through realistic testing

### Prototyping Approaches

#### Fidelity Considerations
- **Fidelity** = level of detail in the prototype
- Different fidelity needs for different parts/stages of a service
- Low-fidelity prototypes inspire more open discussions
- High-fidelity prototypes better for evaluating details
- Generally, fidelity increases as development progresses:
  - Early stage → exploratory → lower fidelity
  - Later stage → evaluative/communicative → higher fidelity

#### Context (CTX)
- Contextual testing (in realistic environments) provides more reliable feedback
- Lab testing is easier but less realistic
- The closer the context to intended implementation, the more reliable the feedback

#### Iterative Process
- Plan prototyping as a series of iterative loops
- Each loop addresses different questions
- First loops are often exploratory in nature
- Continuously verify that selected loops deliver expected results
- Consider establishing sprint-like structure for iterations

#### Multitracking
- Can prototype multiple concepts simultaneously (parallel)
- Or refine a single concept through sequential iterations (series)
- Parallel approaches provide comparative insights
- Sequential approaches allow progressive refinement

### Prototyping Planning

#### Assessment Framework
Future-state journey mapping helps break projects into prototypable elements:
- Interactions and key points
- Physical objects
- Spaces and architecture
- Digital and software elements
- Ecosystems and business value models

#### Resource Allocation
- Wisely allocate time, money, and people
- Decide on audience, authorship, fidelity levels, and iteration loops
- Consider multi-tracking opportunities for parallel testing

#### Method Selection
- Choose methods that provide the most useful data for subsequent iterations
- Use method triangulation (multiple complementary methods)
- Rule of thumb: include at least one method for each:
  - Validating core value proposition
  - Customer experience exploration
  - Key elements testing

#### Question-Driven Approach
- Each prototype should answer specific research questions
- Questions guide the design and evaluation of prototypes
- Selecting the focus is "the art of prototyping"

### Team Roles in Prototyping

Multiple roles contribute to effective prototyping:
1. **Concept Owner** - Original ideator
2. **Model Maker** - Creates scripts, sketches scenes, prepares props
3. **Facilitator** - Guides audience through the testing session
4. **Actors & Operators** - Assist during sessions, play roles as needed
5. **Researcher** - Observes and documents insights
6. **Experts & Stakeholders** - Provide specialized knowledge and skills

One person can fulfill multiple roles, especially in early stages of the process.

### Participant Considerations

#### Audience Selection
- Similar principles to research participant recruitment
- Goal is to get as close as possible to real users
- Internal testing can be a useful shortcut in some cases

#### Testing Formats
- A/B testing approaches (2x2 design) can be effective
- Can range from face-to-face to online integration
- Consider balanced sampling of different user types

## Implementation Considerations

### Service Integration
The implementation phase brings together:
- Concept work
- Business model
- Brand focus
- Technology requirements
- Management approach

### Balancing Elements
One of the key challenges is balancing:
- Individual component prototyping
- Holistic service journey integration

This balance requires careful consideration of both detailed elements and the overall service experience.
