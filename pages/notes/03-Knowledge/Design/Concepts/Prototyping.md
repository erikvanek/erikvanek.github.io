# Prototyping

## Overview
Prototyping is the iterative process of creating representations of design solutions before final implementation. It allows designers to explore, evaluate, and communicate ideas rapidly while maximizing learning and minimizing risk.

## Core Principles

### Purpose of Prototyping
- **"The best way to have an idea is to have a lot of ideas"**
- Tool for self-expression and enhanced understanding between stakeholders
- Maximize learning through rapid iteration
- Replace actual implementation to accelerate the learning cycle
- Set up and built so we can extract meaningful insights

### Key Characteristics
- Never rely on a single prototype - they are meant to fail and provide learning
- Should be cheap to change or discard
- Can focus holistically or on individual aspects of a solution
- Functions as the design equivalent of learning in human development

## Prototyping Process

### Stages of Prototyping
1. **Exploration** - Generate multiple possibilities
2. **Refinement** - Focus on promising directions
3. **Evaluation** - Test with users and stakeholders
4. **Implementation** - Move toward final solution

### Fidelity Spectrum
- **Low-fidelity** ([[Lo-Fi_Prototyping_Methods]])
  - Sketches, paper prototypes
  - Wizard of Oz simulations
  - Role-playing activities
- **Medium-fidelity**
  - Clickable wireframes
  - Simplified working models
  - Storyboards and scenarios
- **High-fidelity**
  - Functional prototypes
  - Polished visual designs
  - Technical implementations

## Prototype Types

Prototypes can be categorized by what they aim to represent or test:

- [[Actions, processes & experiences prototype]] - Testing flows and interactions
- [[Physical prototypes]] - Tangible objects and hardware
- [[Environment, spaces & architecture prototypes]] - Spatial experiences
- [[Digital & SW prototypes]] - Software and digital experiences
- [[Ecosystem & business value prototypes]] - Service ecosystems and business models

## Best Practices

### Effective Prototyping Approaches
- **Start rough** - Begin with low-fidelity to explore broadly
- **Focus on questions** - Design prototypes to answer specific questions
- **Minimum viable** - Include only what's needed to test the concept
- **Parallel prototyping** - Develop multiple alternatives simultaneously
- **Rapid iteration** - Move quickly between cycles of building and testing
- **User involvement** - Engage users early and often
- **Document learning** - Capture insights from each prototype iteration

### Common Pitfalls
- Premature commitment to a single direction
- Over-polishing before validating core concepts
- Testing too many variables simultaneously
- Failing to define clear learning objectives
- Not involving real users

## Relation to Design Process
Prototyping serves as a bridge between conceptual models (the interface people interact with) and mental models (what humans have in mind). Effective prototyping aligns these models through iterative exploration and validation.
