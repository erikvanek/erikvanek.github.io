- focus on proper screening before hiring for a research study
- when cold calling, include a clear CTA when reaching out
	- screening form
	- Calendly link to book a time slot directly
	- it works better to send emails directly to specific people, not to use generic mailboxes like _info@entity.domain_
- be aware of time friction you can't predict
	- approval rounds, vacations, internal (de)motivation, hesitancy, ...
	- writing an email won't yield interviewees for your tomorrow's free time slot
- iterative / adaptive recruitment
	- start with a small circle / batch of people, then see how they react, possibly adapt your copy and reach out further
	- you need to balance out the amount of participants you're interested in to those you need to weed out
	- it takes time and focus if spread way too much
- realistically consider 5 – 20 % response rate during cold calling, previous exposure increases chances of people responding back
- my approach – Kobe Bryant method – You don't score if you don't shoot – if I need to have 10 respondents I need to fire at least 100 mails, maybe more
- it is worth using [[Calendly]] for scheduling
