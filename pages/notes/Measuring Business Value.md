# Measuring Business Value

## Outcomes vs. Impact (from [[Books/Outcomes_over_Output|Outcomes over Output]])
- Outcomes (behavior change) → impact (increase in revenue, loyalty...)
- Impact is a side effect of well-designed outcomes
- Leaders think about impact, executors are responsible for outputs and outcome
- Example pathway: impact (reduce cost) → outcome (fewer people calling tech support) → output (improved usability of confusing features)

## Indicators and Metrics
- Leading vs. lagging indicators:
  - Lagging tells you what happened in the past and have limited predictive power
  - Leading indicator has a proven relationship between an action and a result
- Leading indicators show hit or miss the target, lagging indicators reveal the target
- Key results in OKRs are by outcomes - having an outcome (measurable human behavior) almost automatically gives key result definition

## Product Metrics (from [[Knowledge/Design/CX_Metriky|CX Metriky]])
- **North Star Metric**: One key indicator reflecting the main value of your product, expressing the main long-term goal and measuring how well the product meets customer needs (e.g., number of viewing hours for a streaming service)
- **OKR (Objectives - Key Results)**: Framework for setting ambitious goals and measurable results, focusing on qualitative, inspiring goals supported by specific metrics, typically used in quarterly cycles
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicators)**: Specific metrics for operational performance monitoring, all KPIs are metrics, but not all metrics are KPIs
- **Pirate/AARRR Framework**: Startup framework for measuring customer journey:
  - **A**cquisition: How users find your product
  - **A**ctivation: First experience and "wow" moment
  - **R**etention: How well you keep users engaged
  - **R**evenue: How the product generates income
  - **R**eferral: How users recommend your product
- **Common Product Metrics**:
  - Conversion Rate: Percentage of visitors who perform a desired action
  - Retention Rate: Percentage of customers who return after a certain period
  - Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who stop using your product

## Hypothesis-Driven Approach
- Hypothesis has two parts: the thing we believe in and the evidence we look for to be able to (dis)prove it
- Next step with hypothesis is to define what needs to happen to find out if the hypothesis is right or wrong
- When we state goals with outcomes, we propose some relationship between our work and its results which we can capture in a hypothesis
- Test with an experiment

## Customer Signals (from [[Books/The_Mom_Test|The Mom Test]])
- Major currencies our partners are investing are time, reputation risk and money
- Sometimes strong commitment combines multiple currencies
- Not having a chance to be introduced to other stakeholders is a bad sign
- It's not a real lead until you gave them a concrete chance to reject you
- Look for "This is the worst part of my life and you can help me fix it" as those might be most prospective clients

## The Outcomes Learning Cycle
- Build experiments
- Measure outcomes
- Learn and iterate
