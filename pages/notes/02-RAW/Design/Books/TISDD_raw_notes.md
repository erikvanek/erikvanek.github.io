# Raw Transcription of TISDD Book Notes

## Page 1

- later on we can build more specialized ptd like UXs, ethnographers...
- always be aware of the bias you bring & associated influence
   e.g. concept owners have tendency to make the prototype survive...
- ... fidelity = level of detail
- economic principle of prototyping: "The best prototype
  is the one that in its simplest way makes the pos-
  sibilities and limitations of a design idea visible & measurable"
- different fidelity needs for different parts/stages
- lo-fi tend to inspire more open discussions
  while hi-fi are more about details
- (usually the later the stage, the higher the fidelity))
- usually early "explorative", later = evaluative & communicative

### CTX
- contextual x (lab → obsr. preferred, but more difficult/
  the closer the CTX to the intended impl, more reliable feedbck

### Loops
- always plan prototyping as an iterative series of loops
  to each w/ different questions
- first loops are often exploratory
- continuously check that selected loops deliver expected results
- consider establishing sprint-like structure

### Multitracking
- can be in parallel or in sequence → [diagram with arrows]

### Method selection
- the key to method selection is to choose those that give
  you the most useful data to support later iterations
- method triangulation
- a rule of thumb - one of each:
  - validating core value proposition
  - CX exploration e.g. desktop/CTX walkthroughs, 
    business origami, AX model canvas/map
  - key elements e.g. paper/cardboard prototypes, mockups,...

- it answers the question "How do we create value?" i.e. what
  can the service do/fulfill/address [Triangle diagram with FEASIBILITY/VALUE/VIABILITY and arrows]

### Assessing what to build
- future-state journeys can help to
  break down the project into:
  - IXs, KPs
  - phys. objects
  - spaces/architecture
  - dig./software
  - ecosystems, (business) values
- prototyping portfolio can help decide on what to prototype

### Planning prototyping
- wisely allocate time, money & ppl
- decides audience, authorship, fidelity, loops, multitracking

### Audience
- similar to when recruiting for research
- goal is to get as close as possible to real users
- but shortcuts like internal testing could work/suffice

### Roles
- concept owner - who came up w/ the idea
- model maker - the person writing the script and sketching out the scene, preparing props
- facilitator - guides the audience through the session
- actors & operators - assist the facilitator during the session,
  can be acting as staff, or mock customers
- researcher - independent observer recording insights
- experts & key stakeholders - adding special skills
  and deep knowledge
- often one person can hold multiple roles,
  especially at the beginning

### Recruiting options
- can be A-B (2x2) instead of any pair/size

### Physical formats
- from existing & FTF to online integration

### Prototyping
- to reduce uncertainty/risk, identify & explore
  alternative solutions & build on what works
- create a shared understanding of ideas & concepts
- the art of balancing part prototyping vs. holistic service-journey
- often uncovers new questions and sends team back to the team
- reducing bias by prototyping & testing in realistic CTXs

### Purpose
- deciding why we're prototyping & what we want to achieve
  upfront is important
- usually for 3 main reasons:
  - to explore new options & future solutions, "ideation at work"
  - mostly done for yourself or the core team
  - to evaluate / as evaluative - to explore how people experience
    the future we're suggesting, usually helps to converge and
    reduce options you have and clarify what to focus on
    - sessions usually include a set of hypotheses to be tested
  - to communicate / as communicative - tailored prototypes
    to specific audience to reduce misunderstandings
    and to kickstart meaningful discussions w/ relevant ppl
    - should reduce friction

### Questions
- each phase states relevant question prototype should answer
- think of them as research questions
- selecting the focus of the prototype is the art of prototyping
- where prototypes are a great starting point

### THIS IS SERVICE DESIGN DOING

- create - customer research / front
- makes visible what other companies' similar approach already made
- how they innovate and think of what/how more be there
- finding customer needs
- a dumping & dating process
- I & shadow customer journeys
- contextual interviews
- will also be met needs / insights
- it's not feasibility but desirability (referring to tri model)

### BASIC PROCESS
- research → shapes ideas → prototyping → pilot → implement
- backcasting (vs journey e-knowledge) builds on:
  - ideas of future scenarios
  - concept development
  - iterating to build brief
- when doing (customer) testing / research get to know:
  - people (customers / employees / and other stakeholders)
  - human behavior
  - 2D/3D physical space
  - existing or future interactions

### Doing
- Is doing everything together (concept + business + model + brand focus + technology + management)
