- _small-n_ research
- it is _not_ statistically significant
- we can't generalize from small sample sizes, it is _just different_ than quantitative research
	- it is a complement to qualitative research
	- the goal isn't to disprove hypothesis, we're looking to understand the problem in detail
- _helps to understand 'the why' behind the problem and its possible root causes_, qualitative research would only allow us to speculate
- the goal is to gather insights to make informed decisions later
- by quantification in our analysis we're opening ourselves up to a quantitative judgement
	- "three of six" kind of statements can be easily disregarded
## [[Rules of qualitative rigor|Rules for qualitative rigor]] 
1. Credibility - confidence in the 'truth' of the findings
2. Transferability - showing that the findings have applicablity in other contexts
3. Dependability - showing that the findings are consistent and could be repeated
4. Confirmability - a degree of neutraility or the extent to which the findings of a study are shaped by the respondents and not researcher bias, motivation, or interest.
- done by Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba
- we can satisfy those by being _systematic_
## Systematic qualitative research
- formulates a specific _research question before research_ is conducted
- samples carefully by recruiting participants to help to deeply understand the subject matter
- facilitates research sessions with _open-ended prompts_
- does not take only opinions but _tries to understand 'the why'_ behind them
- _analyzes the data continuously_ by coding and concluding from the data
- __attempts to triangulate__ when facing something extraordinary or unusual to ensure that our conclusions are supported by data
- says what the problem is, quantitative says how bad it is
- helps to build an empathetic understanding of our users
