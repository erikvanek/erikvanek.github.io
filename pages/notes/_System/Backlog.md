# Second Brain System Backlog

This document tracks pending tasks, improvements, and refinements for the second-brain knowledge management system.

## High Priority

- [ ] Remove redundant Prompts file
- [ ] Check if any 06-System folder references remain in other files outside _System
- [ ] Run empty file cleanup to identify and fix any broken references
- [ ] Review and optimize tagging across existing knowledge base

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Create domain-specific processing templates for specialized content
- [ ] Develop a system for tracking knowledge gaps
- [ ] Improve cross-domain linking between knowledge areas
- [ ] Create visualization of knowledge graph structure
- [ ] Implement quarterly review process for system health

## Low Priority

- [ ] Explore advanced Obsidian plugins for knowledge visualization
- [ ] Design knowledge retrieval exercises to test system effectiveness
- [ ] Create workflow for incorporating external feedback into knowledge base
- [ ] Develop metrics for measuring knowledge base growth and usage

## Ideas for Future Exploration

- Implement spaced repetition for key insights
- Create project template that pulls from knowledge base
- Develop specialized MOCs for cross-cutting concerns
- Explore integration with other tools in workflow

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Merged Prompts into KB_Protocol for unified reference
- [x] Restructured system folder and file naming for easier retrieval
- [x] Added system backlog for tracking improvements
- [x] Standardized Claude interaction protocols

## Notes

This backlog should be reviewed monthly to prioritize next actions and track progress. When implementing changes from this backlog, remember to:

1. Update the changelog with what was changed
2. Mark items as completed rather than removing them
3. Add new items as they are identified
4. Reference the specific changes in relevant system documentation

## Reference

This backlog supports the system described in:
- [[KB_Protocol]]
- [[Master_Prompt]]
- [[Guide]]
- [[Workflow]]
