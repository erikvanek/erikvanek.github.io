# Second Brain Workflow

This document details the step-by-step workflow for maintaining and using your second-brain system, based on your original requirements.

## Regular Capture Process

### 1. Daily Capture
- Use the dedicated braindump folder in Obsidian for quick thoughts
- Take photos of handwritten notes and place in the 00-Inbox/Images folder
- Save digital notes directly to 00-Inbox folder
- Record audio notes when appropriate and place in 00-Inbox/Audio folder

### 2. Regular Processing (Daily/Weekly)
Schedule regular time to process accumulated inputs:

1. **Select an item** from your 00-Inbox folder
2. **Determine the processing needs**:
   - Does it need transcription?
   - Is linearization required?
   - What level of restructuring is needed?
   - How should it be chunked?
   - Where in your knowledge base does it belong?

3. **Use Claude** to assist with processing:
   - For complex items, use the detailed Claude processing prompt
   - For simpler items, use the quick processing prompt
   - Review Claude's output and make any necessary adjustments

4. **Store the raw data** in the 02-RAW folder with appropriate categorization
   - Preserve the original form for future reference

5. **Place processed content** in the 03-Knowledge folder:
   - In the appropriate domain subfolder
   - With proper frontmatter and tags
   - Including a "Related Notes" section with Obsidian links
   - With consistent formatting and structure

6. **Update connections**:
   - Add links to this note from related notes
   - Update relevant Maps of Content (MOCs)
   - Check if any tags need to be added to improve discoverability

## Periodic Maintenance

### Monthly Review
- Process any backlog in the 00-Inbox folder
- Review recent additions for consistency and connection quality
- Update domain MOCs with new content

### Quarterly Reshuffling
1. **Identify areas for reshuffling**:
   - Notes that have grown beyond A4 size
   - Clusters of tiny, closely related notes
   - Areas where navigation feels cumbersome

2. **Analyze selected areas**:
   - Use Claude to help analyze knowledge structure
   - Identify specific reshuffling needs
   - Prioritize areas that will benefit most from reorganization

3. **Perform reshuffling**:
   - Split oversized notes into connected smaller notes
   - Combine related tiny notes into more coherent units
   - Ensure proper bidirectional linking
   - Update relevant MOCs

4. **Review templates**:
   - Evaluate how well templates are serving your needs
   - Adjust templates based on actual usage patterns
   - Consider new template types if needed

5. **Document changes** in the maintenance log

## Using Your Second Brain

### Project Preparation
When starting a new project or initiative:

1. **Define your information needs**:
   - What knowledge domains are relevant?
   - What specific questions need answering?
   - What prior experiences might be helpful?

2. **Query your knowledge base**:
   - Search by relevant tags
   - Navigate through appropriate MOCs
   - Follow bidirectional links between related concepts

3. **Compile relevant knowledge**:
   - Use Claude to help extract and organize relevant information
   - Create a project-specific note with references to existing knowledge
   - Identify any knowledge gaps that need to be filled

### Ongoing Learning Integration
As you learn new things:

1. **Capture new insights** in the appropriate format
2. **Process** according to the standard workflow
3. **Connect** to existing knowledge
4. **Review** periodically to strengthen associations

## Workflow Optimization

This workflow is designed to be:

- **Flexible**: Adapt steps based on content type and needs
- **Sustainable**: Manageable time commitments for processing
- **Progressive**: Build knowledge incrementally
- **Balanced**: Maintain equilibrium between raw capture and refined knowledge

The goal is to make this process second nature, allowing your knowledge base to grow organically while remaining useful and accessible. Regular use of the system will help refine the workflow to better suit your specific needs and working style.

## Reference
This workflow is based on the original system requirements and vision documented in [[Master_Prompt]].
