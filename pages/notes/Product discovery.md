- is all about discovering solutions to the business problems we are assigned in our objectives
- our aim is to **discover** about the problem space – then we what the problem space is
- if you start with a solution in your mind there's no point in doing research
- [Kick off workshop steps](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/discovery-kick-off-workshops/?lm=problem-statements&pt=article)
	- onboard team – decide roles, responsibilities
	- agree norms – e.g. one hour client facing a week, ...
	- defining a problem to be solved with a problem statement
	- *set a goal* – what do we want to achieve by the end of the discovery
	- identify and prioritize unknowns
- create a research plan to tackle these unknowns

## Outcome-Driven Discovery (from [[Books/Outcomes_over_Output|Outcomes over Output]])
- Focus on outcomes (behavior changes) rather than outputs (features)
- Ask "what are the customer behaviors that drive business results?"
- Plan in terms of outcomes, not features with deadlines
- Frame discovery as experiments to test hypotheses
- The 3 magic questions:
  1. What are the user/customer actions that drive business results?
  2. How can we make people do more of these actions?
  3. How do we know that we're right?
- Instead of focusing on lists of features, manage a list of hypotheses with expected metrics
- Example reframe: "IDP redesign" → "boost sales by 10% from IDP"
- Roadmaps should be centered around sets of outcomes not feature delivery deadlines
- A basic problem of output-based planning is not knowing what value each feature brings, making prioritization difficult
- Metaphor: Planning with outputs is like promising to cross a desert of unknown size by a specific date

## Discovery Interviewing (from [[Books/The_Mom_Test|The Mom Test]])
- Be genuinely interested in the customer to open their hearts
- Don't mention your idea/solution too soon - focus on their problems first
- Ask "Talk me through the last time [problem] happened" to get concrete examples
- Beware of compliments ("We love it") and hypothetical statements (would/could/might) - they're often fluff
- Plan the three most important things you want to learn from each interview
- Look for customers who express emotion about their problems - they might be your best prospects
