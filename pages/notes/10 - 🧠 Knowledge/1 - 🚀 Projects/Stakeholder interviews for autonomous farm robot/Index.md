# Stakeholder Interviews for Autonomous Farm Robot

I'm conducting a set of stakeholder 1:1 interviews with one of my clients to better understand the context of their product, their needs, wishes, challenges or barriers.

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting stakeholder interviews for an autonomous farm robot to understand the context, needs, and challenges of various stakeholders involved. The goal is to gather deep insights that will inform the development process and ensure the product meets actual user needs.

## 15-Minute Head-Start Guide

### 1. Interview Preparation

#### Research Planning
- **Define Clear Research Questions**: Formulate specific questions before interviews that focus on understanding stakeholder contexts, challenges, and needs
- **Sample Selection**: Carefully identify key stakeholders across the value chain (farmers, operators, maintenance staff, farm managers, investors)
- **Research Loops**: Plan for iterative research cycles where findings from early interviews inform later ones
- **Mixed Methods**: Combine interviews with observation of actual farm environments when possible

#### Stakeholder Mapping
- Create a stakeholder map identifying primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders
- Categorize stakeholders by:
  - Direct influence on product decisions
  - End-users who will interact with the robot
  - Organizational decision-makers
  - Technical support/maintenance personnel
- Consider early alignment with specialized teams (safety, legal, finance) for autonomous technology

### 2. Interview Execution

#### Interview Structure (The Mom Test Approach)
1. **Introduction**: Establish rapport, explain research goals, set expectations (no wrong answers)
2. **Past Behavior Focus**: Ask about specific instances/experiences rather than hypotheticals
3. **Problem Exploration**: Understand challenges before discussing solutions
4. **Signal Identification**: Watch for emotional responses indicating critical pain points
5. **Concrete Commitments**: Look for willingness to invest time, reputation, or money

#### Effective Question Techniques
- Use **"Talk me through the last time..."** to get specific examples
- **Avoid banned words**: would/could/might (indicates hypothetical situations)
- **Delay solution discussion**: Focus on understanding problems thoroughly first
- **Watch for commitment signals**: Deep emotion about problems is valuable
- **Apply the VISION â†’ FRAMING â†’ WEAKNESS â†’ PEDESTAL â†’ HELP framework** for interview flow

### 3. Data Analysis

#### Systematic Approach to Analysis
- **Continuous Analysis**: Begin coding and analysis during the interview cycle, not just at the end
- **Thematic Analysis**: Identify emerging patterns across interviews
- **Code Development**: Use descriptive codes (what's happening) and interpretive codes (analytical perspective)
- **Multiple Review Passes**: Initial coding â†’ organization â†’ refinement â†’ narrative development
- **Team Involvement**: Include others in the analysis process when possible

#### Quality Criteria (Lincoln & Guba)
- **Credibility**: Ensure truthfulness of findings through triangulation
- **Transferability**: Consider how findings apply to different contexts
- **Dependability**: Maintain consistency in the research process
- **Confirmability**: Minimize researcher bias through systematic methods

### 4. Knowledge Gaps & Opportunities

#### Potential Weak Spots in Current Knowledge
- **Technical Understanding**: May need to bridge knowledge gaps between technical capabilities and stakeholder expectations
- **Agricultural Context Specificity**: Different farm types may have vastly different needs
- **Regulatory Landscape**: Autonomous technology in agriculture faces evolving regulations
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Understanding support needs for complex technology in harsh environments

#### Outcome-Based Focus
- Define success metrics based on behavioral changes, not just feature implementation
- For each stakeholder, identify what behaviors predict success/failure
- Establish clear indicators for how stakeholder behavior would change if the product succeeds

## Templates & Resources

### Interview Introduction Template
Use the Czech or translated version of your interview introduction script that establishes:
- Transparency about research goals
- Permission for recording
- No-pressure environment for "right answers"
- Focus on concrete examples from the past

### Interview Reflection Template
After each interview, complete a reflection capturing:
1. Most valuable insights
2. Effective techniques that worked
3. Interview challenges encountered
4. Actionable takeaways
5. Next steps

## Next Steps
1. Create a comprehensive stakeholder map for the autonomous farm robot
2. Develop specific research questions for different stakeholder groups
3. Prepare interview guides tailored to each stakeholder type
4. Set up a system for ongoing analysis during the interview process
5. Plan for synthesis and presentation of findings
