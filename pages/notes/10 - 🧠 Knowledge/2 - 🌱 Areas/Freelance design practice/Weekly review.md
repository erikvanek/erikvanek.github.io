- start focus time
- tell Claude to process inbox notes
- assign 30 min blocks for weekly plan and 60 mins for weekly review next week
	- go through weekly plan and mark what worked and what happened and what did not
- assign 2x 30 min email blocks on Tue and Thu afternoon preferably
- go through "scheduled" label in Todoist and see what got checked off
- review successes and failures
	- are there some reflections that are worth mentioning?
		- add to [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0)
- go through incomplete tasks from last week and and either put them to plan for next week or drop to todoist
- add things to plan for next week
- add things for next month plan if needed
- review Claude's processing, review and adjust
	- once good
		- dump items from **Dump**
		- commit and push
	- if not good
		- adjust and re-do
- can I get more inspired by [Todoist's](https://www.todoist.com/cs/productivity-methods/weekly-review)?
