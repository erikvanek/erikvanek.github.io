- inspired by [Cal](https://calnewport.com/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/)
- check [monthly plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ancN_R9ajIWRfatP1-e8bvIDxuE-geb94QEMWX_ryBw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8kvcbmns5nyc)
- check [last week plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJE5iGa9NmfpYFH8jHvW_XKj4s9JB923VJPrvS2GeGQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2warsxnxikjt) and what did not work out
	- do I want to drag it on?
- go through projects and plan what needs attention this week
	- define one top-most priority for the week and bold it out
- go through the list of previous [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.yvqbqolelrf4) (last 5 weeks) and inspire and learn from them â€“ ideally with something that can be applied to this week
	- aim at one or two things / goals to apply this week
- Go through **important and self-betterment** tasks and see how to fit them in
	- Can I squeeze one **important** item to my schedule?
- Try to focus assign deep work blocks for the rest of the week
