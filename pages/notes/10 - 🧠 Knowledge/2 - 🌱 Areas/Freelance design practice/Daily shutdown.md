- shutdown ritual for 15 minutes
## Steps
0. start focus mode
1. clean table
2. close all tabs in all spaces
3. go through #Inbox in Todoist and empty it by categorizing each item there where it belongs
	- Is there something too big? try to split it
	- Is it something for tomorrow? Put it to #tomorrow and schedule a block for it tomorrow if that works
4. review
	- daily successes
	- daily failures
	- note significant ones to the weekly review
	- review my [weekly plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJE5iGa9NmfpYFH8jHvW_XKj4s9JB923VJPrvS2GeGQ/edit?tab=t.0) and edit it if needed
	- calendar for next 2 weeks and adjust if needed
5. timesheets
   - fill in all relevant timesheets
6. prepare for tomorrow
	- prepare the frog to eat in the morning for tomorrow
	- and put it almost at the top of #tomorrow - make sure there is a simple task before it to kickstart a momentum
7. enjoy **"Pro dnes m√°m hotovo!"**
