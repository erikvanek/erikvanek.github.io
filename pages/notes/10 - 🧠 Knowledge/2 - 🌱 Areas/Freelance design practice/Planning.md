# Monthly
- once a month
	- what are activities I'm involved in?
	- what are their priorities?
	- roughly how much time they take?
	- write them down on a piece of paper
	- assign 1hour blocks for next month planning and review
	- check weekly planning and review if needs to be adjusted
		- not needed (check next time, was not needed last time)
	- write a plan of what I expect to achieve in next month and review at the end of it
