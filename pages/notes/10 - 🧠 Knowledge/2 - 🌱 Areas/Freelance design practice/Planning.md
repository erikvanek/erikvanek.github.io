# Monthly
- once a month
	- what are activities I'm involved in?
	- what are their priorities?
	- roughly how much time they take?
	- write them down on a piece of paper
	- assign 1hour blocks for next month planning and review
	- check weekly planning and review if needs to be adjusted
		- not needed (check next time, was not needed last time)
	- write a plan of what I expect to achieve in next month and review at the end of it

### Planning
- inspired by [Cal](https://calnewport.com/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/)
- check [monthly plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ancN_R9ajIWRfatP1-e8bvIDxuE-geb94QEMWX_ryBw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8kvcbmns5nyc)
- check [last week plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJE5iGa9NmfpYFH8jHvW_XKj4s9JB923VJPrvS2GeGQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2warsxnxikjt) and what did not work out
	- do I want to drag it on?
- go through projects and plan what needs attention this week
	- define one top-most priority for the week and bold it out
- go through the list of previous [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.yvqbqolelrf4) (last 5 weeks) and inspire and learn from them â€“ ideally with something that can be applied to this week
	- aim at one or two things / goals to apply this week
- Go through **important and self-betterment** tasks and see how to fit them in
	- Can I squeeze one **important** item to my schedule?
- Try to focus assign deep work blocks for the rest of the week
### Review
- start focus time
- tell Claude to process inbox notes
- assign 30 min blocks for weekly plan and 60 mins for weekly review next week
	- go through weekly plan and mark what worked and what happened and what did not
- go through "scheduled" label in Todoist and see what got checked off
- review successes and failures
	- are there some reflections that are worth mentioning?
		- add to [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0)
- go through incomplete tasks from last week and and either put them to plan for next week or drop to todoist
- add things to plan for next week
- add things for next month plan if needed
- review Claude's processing, review and adjust
	- once good
		- dump items from **Dump**
		- commit and push
- can I get more inspired by [Todoist's](https://www.todoist.com/cs/productivity-methods/weekly-review)?
