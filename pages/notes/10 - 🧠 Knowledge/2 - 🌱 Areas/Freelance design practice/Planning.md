# Monthly
- once a month
	- what are activities I'm involved in?
	- what are their priorities?
	- roughly how much time they take?
	- write them down on a piece of paper
	- assign 1hour blocks for next month planning and review
	- check weekly planning and review if needs to be adjusted
		- not needed (check next time, was not needed last time)
	- write a plan of what I expect to achieve in next month and review at the end of it

### Planning
- check monthly plan
- go through the list of previous lessons learnt (last 5 weeks) and inspire and learn from them
	- aim at one or two things / goals to apply this week
- check last week plan and what did not work out
	- do I want to drag it on?
- inspired by [Cal](https://calnewport.com/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/)
- go through projects and plan what needs attention this week
- Go through important and see how to fit them in
- Try to focus assign deep work blocks for the rest of the week
- Can I squeeze one **important** item to my schedule?
### Review
- start focus time
- tell Claude to process inbox notes
- assign 1h blocks for weekly plans and review next week
	- go through weekly plan and mark what worked and what happened and what did not
- 
- review successes and failures
- are there some reflections that need to be made?
	- if they are short, do them now
	- if not, plan for next week
- create [lessons learnt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osFt0K5-JgpnrylTbsdDNvtcjI2beR-VD2HMYufPy1I/edit?tab=t.0) and compile new action items
- go through incomplete tasks from last week and and either put them to plan for next week or drop to todoist
- add things to plan for next week
- add things for next month plan if needed
- review Claude's processing, review and adjust
- can I get more inspired by [Todoist's](https://www.todoist.com/cs/productivity-methods/weekly-review)?
# Daily
- inspiration from [todoist](https://www.todoist.com/cs/inspiration/end-work-day)
- shutdown ritual for 15 minutes
## Steps
0. start focus mode
1. clean table
2. close all tabs in all spaces
3. go through #Inbox in Todoist and empty it by categorizing each item there where it belongs
	- Is there something too big? try to split it
	- Is it something for tomorrow? Put it to #tomorrow and schedule a block for it tomorrow if that works
4. review
	- daily successes
	- daily failures
	- note significant ones to the weekly review
	- review my weekly plan and edit it if needed
	- calendar for next 2 weeks and adjust if needed
5. timesheets
   - fill in all relevant timesheets
6. prepare for tomorrow
	- prepare the frog to eat in the morning for tomorrow
	- and put it almost at the top of #tomorrow - make sure there is a simple task before it to kickstart a momentum
7. enjoy **"Pro dnes m√°m hotovo!"**
