# PKM Improvements Backlog

Based on deep research and analysis of current second brain practices, this backlog contains concrete improvements to enhance knowledge utilization for design work.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Project Knowledge Maps
**Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Learning Loops  
**Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Discovery Triggers

## ðŸ“‹ **Improvement Queue**

### ðŸš€ **Ready to Implement**

#### 1. Project Knowledge Maps
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High (immediate impact)
- **Effort**: Low (builds on existing workflow)
- **Implementation Guide**: [[PKM Improvement 1 - Project Knowledge Maps]]
- **Next Action**: Schedule 30min setup session in weekly planning
- **Success Metric**: Knowledge map created for next new project

### ðŸ“… **Planned**

#### 2. Learning Loops Enhancement  
- **Status**: Planned for Week 5
- **Priority**: Medium (long-term growth)
- **Effort**: Medium (requires routine changes)
- **Implementation Guide**: [[PKM Improvement 2 - Learning Loops]]
- **Dependency**: Complete Phase 1 first
- **Next Action**: Review after 4 weeks of Project Knowledge Maps

#### 3. Discovery Triggers System
- **Status**: Planned for Week 9
- **Priority**: Medium (experimental)
- **Effort**: Medium (new habits required)
- **Implementation Guide**: [[PKM Improvement 3 - Discovery Triggers]]
- **Dependency**: Established routines from Phases 1-2
- **Next Action**: Experiment design after Phase 2 completion

## ðŸ”„ **Integration with Existing Routines**

### Weekly Review Integration
Add to your [[Weekly review]] routine:
- **Week 1-4**: "Did I create a knowledge map for any new projects this week?"
- **Week 5-8**: "What insights from this week's work should feed back into my knowledge base?"
- **Week 9+**: "What unexpected connections did I discover this week?"

### Weekly Planning Integration  
Add to your [[Weekly planning]] routine:
- Check this backlog for current phase requirements
- Schedule time blocks for implementation activities
- Review progress on success metrics

## ðŸ“Š **Progress Tracking**

### Phase 1: Project Knowledge Maps
- [ ] Setup initial template and process
- [ ] Create knowledge map for first project
- [ ] Refine process based on initial experience
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Integrate into standard project workflow

### Phase 2: Learning Loops
- [ ] Enhance [[Process reflection]] template
- [ ] Complete first enhanced project reflection
- [ ] Conduct first "Knowledge-to-Content" session
- [ ] Establish monthly routine
- [ ] Create first piece of thought leadership content

### Phase 3: Discovery Triggers
- [ ] Design weekly "Knowledge Archaeology" routine
- [ ] Create first set of "Thinking Triggers" notes
- [ ] Implement "Random Walk Wednesdays"
- [ ] Enhance Newsletter Digest with connection-making
- [ ] Evaluate effectiveness after 30 days

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Indicators**

**Short-term** (1 month):
- Faster project startup through knowledge reuse
- More systematic capture of project insights

**Medium-term** (3 months):
- Visible improvement in project quality due to applied past learning
- Regular creation of industry-relevant content from work insights

**Long-term** (6 months):
- Recognized thought leadership in design community
- Client attraction through demonstrated expertise
- Faster problem-solving through pattern recognition

## ðŸ”§ **Maintenance Schedule**

**Monthly**: Review progress and adjust implementation approach
**Quarterly**: Evaluate overall impact and plan next improvements
**Semi-annually**: Conduct full PKM system assessment

## ðŸ“š **Related Notes**

- [[Process reflection]] - Current project reflection template
- [[Weekly review]] - Integration point for progress tracking
- [[Weekly planning]] - Implementation scheduling
