- don't do what I don't have done from 80% done from previous efforts
- Cathedral effect applies also to organizing our thoughts in digital space
- Think of organizing information not like a library, but more like a kitchen - sorted by use for a given process
- Key mindset **Taking what you need and forgetting the rest**
- Verum ipsum factum - we only know what we make - **key motivation for rigorous tagging**
- It is important to organize notes by actionability, not by arbitrary categories like topic, date or source
- **Second brain is not meant to hoard information, it is there to put ideas into practice**
- *"Your brain is for having ideas, not for holding them"* – David Allen
- Second brain helps with slow burns as I'm simmering them slowly and eventually can just take what's in there and make it actionable
# Systems
## C-O-D-E
- typical second-brain process
	- Capture
	- Organize
		- wrong way is to organize them is where you find your notes
		- organize things by actionability
	- Distill
		- read, highlight, bold and summarize - ideally parts that are tied to my key objectives defined in [[Priorities]]
	- Express
		- unless we're expressing contents of our second brain to the world, they are somehow useless
## PARA
- Metaphor
	- project is like a meal you're cooking on a stove for a dinner
	- an area for improvement - is a big meal you're cooking in a slow cooker you plan to consume during the week but not sure when you finish
	- resource is like a spice or pasta type you can use to make your next meal
### Projects
- _think of if it like a meal on a stove_
	- "What have I committed to finishing this year?"
	- "What work assignments do I need to complete?"
- short term objectives with deadlines like work assignments or planning a trip
- includes everything you are working on in work or life that has a clear endpoint
- if an idea you have help you complete a project, it should go into this section
- short term and finite
### Areas of improvement
- _think of it like a slow fermenting miso paste that makes me happy long-term_
	- "What must I do exceptionally well to have a successful career?"
	- "What parts of my business need constant attention?"
	- "What areas of my life need constant attention for me to be happy?"
- ongoing commitments with no specific end-date like personal finances or health
- they are long-term and open-ended 
- contains digital notebooks on all the things you're trying to improve or maintain
	- personal
		- e.g. cooking, fitness, personal finance, digital well-being
	- work
		- design, leadership, product management, productivity
- things can move here from projects if, once finished, they are sustained longer - e.g. Drýmtým project
- also things from here can move into projects once an area of improvement yields a specific idea for a project
### Resources
- _resource pantry_
	- "What do I want to research and understand better?"
	- "What examples can I collect to kickstart a project soon?"
	- "What general lists do I frequently use and update?"
- interests or topics I haven't explored but haven't turned to specific projects or areas yet
- personal library of references, facts and inspiration to use for future projects or improvements
	- 3 types of information:
		- examples you've collected and you can use for inspiration
		- actionable insights
			- e.g. "Going keto" notebook here might serve if, once, I decide to give a keto diet a try at some moment in life
		- checklists and useful data from past projects that might be helpful for future projects
### Archives
	
- storage of completed projects, outdated areas or interests that are no longer a priority
- any information I don't want to forget but does not advance a project or area of improvement and will not be used to kickstart a future project
- contains
	- completed projects
	- inactive projects
	- areas you no longer care to improve or maintain
	- resources you don't plan to use anytime soon
- **moving completing or inactive notebooks breathes life into your second brain**
- It's not expected to come to archive often
