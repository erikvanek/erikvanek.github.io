# Goal Frameworks

## AI-assisted summary

Goal frameworks provide structure for understanding the relationship between what we do and why we do it, with Powers' hierarchy distinguishing between stable "Be" goals (who you want to become) and transitory "Do" goals (actions to fulfill Be goals). This framework emphasizes that achieving Do goals isn't the end goal - rather, they're means to achieve the more fundamental Be goals.

Complementing this forward-looking approach, antigoals offer a backward problem-solving strategy that defines constraints to prevent creating new problems while pursuing goals. As Charles Munger advocated, complex problems often become easier when approached in reverse - identifying what to avoid rather than just what to pursue. Antigoals serve as practical constraints like "don't agree to things your gut says no to" or "never take meetings on Monday," helping maintain focus and prevent goal pursuit from creating unintended negative consequences.

- Powers' hierarchy of goals is a **relationship between what we do and why we do it**

## Be goals
- "Be" goals are more stable

## Do goals
- " Do" and motor state goals are more transitory and technology dependent.
- They are the things you do to fulfill a Be goal.
- achieving "Do" goals is not the goal, the goal is to achieve the "Be" goal

## Motor state goals

# Antigoals
- are the **constraints that ensure** you don't create new problems in pursuing those goals.
- a foundational mental model that says that complex problems are often easier solved backwards vs. forwards.
- example framing
	- - Don't `agree to things your gut says no to`
	- Never `take meetings on Monday`
	- No `unpaid speaking gigs`
- Charles Munger:
	- *"All I Want To Know Is Where I'm Going To Die So I'll Never Go There"*
	- *"Problems frequently get easier if you turn them around in reverse. In other words, if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not 'how can I help India,' it's 'what is doing the worst damage in India and how do I avoid it?"*
