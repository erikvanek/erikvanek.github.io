- And the only way to keep learning and evolving is to have an open mind — aka being naive about a given topic or situation
	- Maslow called this childlike fascination and the willingness to appear naive as **_Second Naïveté_**
	- Others have mentioned second naïveté as the ability to revisit a domain of expertise in a completely new light and engaging with it anew to uncover new ideas. **The banal becomes the sublime over time.**
