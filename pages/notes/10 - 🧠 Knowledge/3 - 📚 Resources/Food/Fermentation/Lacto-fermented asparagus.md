# Ingredients
- 1600 g fresh mid-to-thick-width asparagus
	- snapped-off ends and peeled bottoms
	- turns into 1120 g prepared for processing
- 78 g of salt (2.5%)
- 2000 g of water
- 3l mason jar
- spicy pouch
	- 1 tablespoon of coriander seeds
	- 1 tablespoon of fennel seeds
# Process
- pick a reference asparagus size – roughly 5cm shorter than the jar height
	- so that the sealing zip-lock bag I put on top can easily fit – if using a fermentation jar, this step is probably not needed
- cut asparagus ends to fit this size as evenly as possible
- shave of bottom with a speed peeler ~ 10-20% of each stick – the wider the stick, the more it needs shaving – the motivation is get rid of the woody and stringy parts of their skin
- put them to water and rinse any sand or whatever left in them
- prepare a spicy pouch
- place it into the jar
- fit asparagus to the jar as well
- put on scales, tare it, pour water until it reaches the top of the jar and remember how much water it is (in my case it was 2000g)
- pour the water out and add to it the weight of the asparagus
	- then count the amount of salt to dissolve (2.5%) in it
	- in my case it was 2000g (water) + 1120g (asparagus) = 3120 * 0.025 = **78g** of salt
- add that amount of salt to the water, dissolve and pour the water back into the jar
- seal the jar to ensure no air can come in but it can bubble up throughout the process
	- either us a fermentation jar, ziplock method or some other technique
