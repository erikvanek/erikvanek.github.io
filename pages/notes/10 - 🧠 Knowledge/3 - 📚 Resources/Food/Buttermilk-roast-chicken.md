# salt chicken
- salt chicken from both sides well – 1 tablespoon of salt per 1kg of chicken
- let sit 30 mins
# buttermilk mixture
- prepare buttermilk mixture – 500ml of buttermilk for a 1,5kg chicken is fine
- pour 500ml of buttermilk to a bowl, add half a tablespoon of salt
- add flavorings per preference
	- e.g. grind 4 cloves of garlic
	- skin of 1 lemon
	- 1 tablespoon of ground cumin
	- 1 tablespoon of ground coriander seeds
	- .5 tablespoon of ground black pepper
	- 2 tablespoons of paprika
- mix well
# marinate chicken
- place the chicken inside a big zip-lock bag
- pour first part ~ a third ~ of the mixture to the chicken
- the rest on and around
- once coated, get the remaining air from the ziplock and zip tightly
- massage it properly so that the marinade hits the chicken from all sides
- put it to a fridge, preferably overnight – massage every now and then to ensure even coating
# baking
- take the chicken from the fridge at least an hour before baking to warm up a bit
- preheat your oven to 200 deg. Celsius and put a cast iron pan inside
- drain as much marinate as you can from your chicken and pat dry with a paper towel
- once cleaned and an oven (and a skillet) is pre-heated – open the oven and carefully put the chicken back side down to the cast iron
- FYI – most heated part of the oven are back corners so try to have breasts most in the center of the oven while thighs are more in the corner – that should help more even baking
- bake for ~ 60 mins
- after 60 mins – insert a thermometer to the center of a thigh – if the temperature is at least 74, preferably 76, the chicken is done
- **imporatant** – let the bird rest at least 10 minutes, preferably 15-20 – juices will redistribute back to it and it will be easier to handle
