- **Co-design brings together lived experience, lived expertise and professional experience to learn from each other and make things better — by design.** – Kelly Ann McKercher
- Co-design centers the lived experiences of the people, families, and communities themselves. **The designer isn’t in charge of solving problems** or making things, but **rather responsible for enabling others** to find their own solutions.
- Designers don’t have a monopoly on creativity. People are designing solutions every day without formal titles. **Our role should be to amplify and collaborate**, rather than to reinvent the wheel.
## 4 core principles of co-design
- share power
- prioritise relationships
- use participatory means
- build capability
