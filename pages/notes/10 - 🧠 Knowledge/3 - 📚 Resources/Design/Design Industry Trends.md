# Design Industry Trends

- design industry is reinventing itself - tools that are being used now are as new to junior designers as to those in the game for years
- It looks like weâ€™re locked into a phase of innovation driven by cool shit rather than user needs. ML engineers and data scientists will be even more valuable. UX designers and researchers wonâ€™t. â€“ Cennydd Bowles
- Today, much of design is digital and it focuses on strategic thinking rather than just physical products â€“ Ida Persson
