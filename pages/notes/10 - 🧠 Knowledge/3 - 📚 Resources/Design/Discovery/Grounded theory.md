- qualitative method that enables to study a particular phenomenon or process and discover new theories that are based on the collection and analysis of real world data
- _grounded theory is an inductive approach where new theories are derived from the data_
	- data -> theory -> data
- data collection comes in layers, first scratching the surface, then going deeper
- Steps:
	- collecting the data
	- coding / pattern finding
	- theoretical campling
	- estabilishing ona winning theory
- useful when spotting emerging trends or predicting beharior
## the process
1. define a data gathering strategy that __leads towards project goals__
2. data collection
3. [[Coding]] - start with open coding, then continue with [[Selective coding]] after having gone through some [[Axial coding]] based on priorities
	1. it's possible to create code hierarchies
	2. Can help to spot emerging trends
4. Memos - the tool to document categorization and coding
	1. it is useful to track the "why" during this process
	2. new insights can emerge from well defined memos
