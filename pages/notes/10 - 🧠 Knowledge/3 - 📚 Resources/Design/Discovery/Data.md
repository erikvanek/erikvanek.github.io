- be careful not to blindly jump on data-driven bandwagon, instead aim to be data-informed
	- "a company genuinely _informed_ by data understands the risks of datafication and adopts sophisticated, balanced approaches to strategy that blend quant, qual, and even some of that unfashionable prediction and intuition" – Cennydd Bowles
- Clifford Geertz: thin (quantitative data) description versus thick (qualitative) description and the goal of thick description is to capture broader and richer content
- Tricia Wang: thick data > big data
- to design computational interfaces, we need to balance out well the already present quantitative data with qualitative
- triangulation works best with most diverse set of sources available → that allows us to get thick data
- response given as numerical data will usually get the majority of affirming nods compared to qualitative data as quantified data appear more like "facts"
