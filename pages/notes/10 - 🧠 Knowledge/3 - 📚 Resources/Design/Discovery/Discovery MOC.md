# Discovery Map of Content

## Overview
Discovery is the initial phase of design and product development that seeks to understand problems, needs, and contexts before proposing solutions. This MOC collects methods, frameworks, and practices for effective discovery work.

## Key Concepts
- [[Problem framing|Problem Framing]] - How to properly define the problem space
- [[Insight|Insights]] - Extracting meaningful insights from research
- [[Research question|Research Questions]] - Crafting effective questions to guide discovery

## Research Methods
- [[Interviews|Interviewing Techniques]] - Methods for effective stakeholder interviews
- [[Design research|Design Research Principles]] - Foundations of design research
- [[Ethnographic observation|Ethnographic Methods]] - Observational research techniques
- [[Focus groups|Focus Groups]] - When and how to use group discussions
- [[Desk research|Desk Research]] - Secondary research methods
- [[Triangulation|Research Triangulation]] - Validating findings through multiple methods
