# Ethnographic observation

## Participant observation
- immersing into lives of participants
- e.g. shadowing, day in life, work-along
- beware of "the observer effect"
- _encourage to think aloud_
- observe what they are & also what they are _not_ doing well

## Auto-ethnography
- exploring particular XP by myself & documenting that XP
- variants:
	- mystery shopping
	- service safari
	- diary studies
- record both first & second-level concepts separately

## Online ethnography
- try to dive into relevant online communities
