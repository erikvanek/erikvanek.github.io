# Desk research

- preparatory research method
	- a tool to build right questions to ask a client during a research
- basically for me to get to know the context better
- uses only secondary data i.e. collected for other projects
- should be the starting point to avoid reinventing the wheel
- e.g. comparing previous "solutions" to similar problems etc
- should be replaced by more in-field techniques later on
