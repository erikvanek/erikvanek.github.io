# Opportunity solution tree

## AI-assisted summary

The opportunity solution tree is a technique from Teresa Torres' book "Continuous Discovery Habits" that provides a structured framework for product discovery. It consists of four hierarchical layers: desired outcomes (business or product outcomes), opportunities (unmet customer needs, pain points, or desires), solutions (products, services, or features), and experiments (assumption testing methods).

The framework helps teams systematically explore customer problems and validate solutions through a structured approach. The key principle for validating opportunities is asking whether there are multiple ways to address each opportunity, ensuring they represent genuine customer needs rather than disguised solutions.

- A technique described in a book **Continuous discovery habits**
- Consists of **layers**
	1. **Desired outcome**
		- What we want to achieve
		- Business outcomes measure the health of the business and are typically financial metrics like grow revenue, increase market share, or reduce churn
		- Product outcomes typically measure a customer behavior in the product or a customer sentiment about the product.
	2. **Opportunity**
		- Opportunity is an unmet customer need, pain point, or desire
		- Opportunities expose gaps in the market where we can immediately create value for our customers
		- Opportunities include needs, pain points, and desires
	3. **Solution**
		- A solution is a product, a service, or a feature that we offer to address an opportunity. The opportunity represents the underlying need, pain point, or desire.
		- E.g. for opportunity *- I'm hungry.* we have solutions:
			- Order takeout
			- Go out to eat at a local restaurant
			- Subscribe to a meal prep service
	4. **[[Experiments]]**
		- The best way to evaluate solutions is through [assumption testing](https://www.producttalk.org/2023/10/assumption-testing/). When we test the assumptions that our ideas depend upon, we collect the compare and contrast data we need to make a better decision.

# Principles
- The best way to test if an opportunity is really a solution in disguise is to ask, *'Is there more than one way to address this opportunity'*?
