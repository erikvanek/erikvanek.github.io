# Hypothesis

- Each idea should be phrased in this format *If we **[ do X]**, then **[ we expect Y to happen]**, because of **[ reason ]***
	- e.g.
		- If we shorten a registration form from 7 to 4 steps the registration count increases because we decrease the amount of cognitive load
		- If we use more visually appealing CTA button, we increase the amount of clicks because it will be more visible
- helps us not to blindly go into [[Experiments]] that are not covered by data
- clearly states what result we expect and how we measure it
	- faster, clearer, happier customer, ...
