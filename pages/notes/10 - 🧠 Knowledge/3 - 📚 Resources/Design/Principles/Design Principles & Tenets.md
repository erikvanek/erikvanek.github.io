# Design Principles & Tenets

## AI-assisted summary

Design principles and tenets serve fundamentally different purposes in product development, with tenets being more effective as decision-making tools. While principles provide general guidance, tenets are bold statements that help teams navigate difficult decisions by codifying solutions to recurring challenges. Apple's Keynote development exemplified this approach with three key tenets: making ugly presentations difficult to create, focusing on cinematic transitions, and optimizing for innovation over compatibility.

The concept extends to how design work is positioned within organizations, where design inevitably exists in every product - the only question being whether it will be good design or not. This reframes design discussions from whether to invest in design to how to ensure quality design execution, challenging the common myth that good design necessarily takes more time.

- Principles are not that helpful compared to tenets (concept by Bob Baxley)
- Tenets are more bold and help guide the product way better
- Tenets are more like decision making tools that the team can return to when facing a difficult decision
- When constructing them â€“ try to look for places where teams return to often, figure it out for once and then codify them
- Example from Apple when making Keynote:
	1. It should be difficult to make ugly presentations
	2. Focus on cinematic quality transitions
	3. Optimize for innovation over powerpoint compatibility
