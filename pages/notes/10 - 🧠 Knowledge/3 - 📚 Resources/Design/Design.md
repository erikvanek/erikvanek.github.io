- __to _design_ is a verb__
- "Splitters" care about UX/[[Service design]]/[[Human-centered design]] differences vs lumpers don't care as long as you practice properly
- when you start - _be shitty, not pretty_ - throw away easily & iterate further
- leverage [[Design Thinking]]
- Uses [[Design tools]] to answer the question "What" & [[Design methods]] to answer the question "How"
- Kat Holmes in [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2023/07/16/mismatch|Mismatch]]: __"Design as a practice that contributes to the society in meaningful ways"__
- [is a rendering of an intent](https://articles.centercentre.com/design_rendering_intent/)
	- when designing for radical [[Innovation]] we need to [inform our intuition](obsidian://open?vault=notes&file=design%2Fresources%2FInforming_Our_Intuition.pdf)
	- is about making trade-offs
		- e.g. adding a few clicks (increasing motor load) to reduce cognitive or visual load
- The best design does not come from individual designerers, but from design teams
- [[Storytelling]] combined [[Insight]]s and clear business cases are helpful to present compelling narratives
- usually split between [[99 - ðŸ“„ To process/Product discovery|Product discovery]] and delivery
- As argued in [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2023/03/23/cradle-to-cradle|Cradle to Cradle]], "being less bad =/= being good" - reducing harm is not the same as creating positive impact
- Sustainable design requires understanding material flows as described by McDonough and Braungart:
  - Biological - materials that can safely return to nature
  - Technical - materials that remain in industrial cycles
- A powerful design question posed in Cradle to Cradle: "What kind of soap does the river want?" - shifting perspective to consider environmental impact from the ecosystem's viewpoint
- Inclusive design, according to Kat Holmes, is fundamentally "about engaging with people that are different than you"
- Three crucial skills for inclusive designers identified in [[10 - ðŸ§  Knowledge/3 - ðŸ“š Resources/Design/Principles/Inclusive Design|Inclusive Design]]:
  1. Identify ability biases and mismatched interactions between people and world
  2. Create a diversity of ways to participate in an experience
  3. Design for interdependence and bring complementary skills together
- The key shift is moving from designingÂ _for_Â others to designingÂ _with_Â them and one way we can do this is through [[Co-design]]
- Is a combination of [sense making and form giving](https://uxdesign.cc/what-is-design-33392df7531d)
- is a continuous process of running experiments, their evaluation and further adjustments
- The role of design is to **bring form around the function**
	- Form acts as a way to set the context â€“ like the way an axe looks and feels in your hand, you get an immediate sense of its purpose
	- By managing inputs and outputs along structured forms, you minimize the cognitive load required to successfully engage with the *product*
