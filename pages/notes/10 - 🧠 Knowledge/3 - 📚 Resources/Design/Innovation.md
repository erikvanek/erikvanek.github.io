# Innovation

- can be seen as a cycle of **creative destruction**
	- two aspects that make systems prone to creative destruction
		- fragile interdependencies
			- e.g. reliance on some vendor-lock like Flash
		- cascade effects
			- often start small, but eventually gain momentum e. g. evolution of mobile data, smartphones,...
- innovation opportunities exist when [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/Customer|Customers]] exhibit compensatory behavior
- anticipation of **what is the next struggle [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/Customer|Customers]] face** after they have sorted out the current one is a key to a successful and continuous innovation
- is about **helping customers make progress** â€“ get them to the better version of live they aspire for
	- progress recognizes that tasks and activities are only means to an end
- Innovate the [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/System of progress|System of progress]], not its parts
- **it isn't customer's job to know what they want**, often they don't know what they want until you slow then
- Good innovations solve problems that formerly had only inadequate solutionsâ€” or no solution

## Quotes
- "Good innovations solve problems that formerly had only inadequate solutions â€” or no solution."

	- thus [[04 - ðŸ’½ RAW/2025/04/06/Customer#Needs|Customer Needs]] are only bound to their imagination and existing experience
- "Change is driven by how people use technology"
	- Josh Zak
