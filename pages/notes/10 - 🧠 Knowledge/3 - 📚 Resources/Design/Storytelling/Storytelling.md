- beginning
	- set expectations
- Telling a compelling story is formed of three resources
	- Situation
		- starting point
	- [[Inciting accident]]
	- Solution
		- resolution (hopefully involving those for whom I tell the story)
- at the end
	- give something to take away
	- sum up expectations, what was delivered and how it matches those expectations
- different arcs

- get inspired by movies, literature etc – they are great at storytelling
- one of the most important skills of a designer
- every headline is a positioning
- **evocation over information**
	- the message has to **make you feel something**
- When coming up with copywriting or storytelling
	- put yourself into the shoes of your audience and ask yourself - does it sound useful or bullshit? what the heck this thing do?
	- how would you refer your friend about the product you just found out? would it "unleash your full potential" or you'd just say "dopest to-do-list because of X..."
- **A headline is a hook** and should work as a hook
	- ideally expressed with brevity and clarity – 3 or 4 words
## Headline structure
	- show me the problem and then solve it
		- look at how it looks on tiktok
	- Solution pitch structure
	- 1] first communicate that I understand you and your problem
	- 2] to get your attention remind you of the problem
	- 3] present you with a solution
	- that's what helps to structure headlines
		- main headline asks the question
		- subhead is as clear as possible in what it does
