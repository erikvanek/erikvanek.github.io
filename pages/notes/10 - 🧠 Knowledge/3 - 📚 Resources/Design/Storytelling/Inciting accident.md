- **Complication or the inciting incident**
- the most important part of [[Storytelling]] is the **inciting incident** - this where the drama gets build and what sets the stage ready for proposing a solution
- something that kickstarts the story, something that profoundly changes the world of the main character
- e.g. the "meet cute" in romantic movies
- nice inspiration from moves [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwimvaj2XqQ](here)
- it might be helpful to support the inciting incident with some more attention as it is the key element of a story
- without it the story basically never starts
- something that pushes the main character out of the comfort zone
