# Communication

- prototype communication â€“ unpolished and frequent is way better than polished and rare
- **get the right people to know what's in your head**
- part of leadership is giving guidance - the ability to give tough feedback is one of the most important competencies
	- sharing **why** with the feedback helps the team to grow themselves and decrease the need for them to seek approval when problem solving
