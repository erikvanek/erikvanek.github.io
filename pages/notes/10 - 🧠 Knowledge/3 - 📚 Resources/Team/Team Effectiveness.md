# Team Effectiveness

- psychological safety as the **most important** factor for team efficiency base on Google's Aristotle project - https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness#introduction
	- The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.
		- **Psychological safety:** A strong team culture was correlated with each member's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.
		- **Dependability:** On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time (vs the opposite - shirking responsibilities).
		- **Structure and clarity:** An individual's understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one's performance are important for team effectiveness.
		- **Meaning:** Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness.
		- **Impact:** The results of one's work, [the subjective judgment that your work is making a difference, is important for teams](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18211139)
- community is close to company culture and it means **being alined on what we're working on, how we're getting there and what we're learning together**
- shift from culture fit â†’ culture add
- diverse teams make better products
- an imbalanced system will produce imbalanced outcomes
- the boundaries of every Temple will nurture safe cultures of like-minded people

## AI-assisted summary

Team effectiveness research, particularly Google's Aristotle project, reveals that team dynamics matter more than individual talent. Key factors include psychological safety (the ability to take risks without fear), dependability (reliable completion of quality work), structure and clarity (clear expectations and processes), meaning (purposeful work), and impact (perception that one's work matters).

These findings emphasize that successful teams focus on how members work together rather than who is on the team. Community and culture alignment around goals, processes, and shared learning create an environment where teams can thrive, with psychological safety emerging as the most critical factor for overall team effectiveness.
