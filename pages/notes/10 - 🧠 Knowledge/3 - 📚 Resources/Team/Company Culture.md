# Company Culture

- community is close to company culture and it means **being alined on what we're working on, how we're getting there and what we're learning together**
	- what the culture is not is happy hours, ping pong tables, foosball tables - that's just stuff in an office
	- culture is what do we say yes to, what do we say no to, what is our standard and how do we help each other to meet that standard and **it is set by the leaaders** â€“ if the leaders are slacking, it's going to be hard to motivate people underneath
