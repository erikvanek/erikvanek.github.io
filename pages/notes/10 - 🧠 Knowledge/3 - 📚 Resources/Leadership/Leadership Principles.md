# Leadership Principles

- to be a great manager â€“ what helps is to have an experience being a great IC before - if one likes the people management part but does not have the respect from ICs by being good in that craft - it's hard to be a good manager without this trust
	- to be able to lead someone â€“ you need to to know what you're talking about and have a good idea what does excellence look like
- part of leadership is giving guidance - the ability to give tough feedback is one of the most important competencies
	- sharing **why** with the feedback helps the team to grow themselves and decrease the need for them to seek approval when problem solving
- **get the right people to know what's in your head**
- During one's personal development â€“ try to map out skills that are relevant for what you want to do and try to excel at one of them â€“ imagine a "one-liner" that you get remembered for and recognized for
- culture is what do we say yes to, what do we say no to, what is our standard and how do we help each other to meet that standard and **it is set by the leaders** â€“ if the leaders are slacking, it's going to be hard to motivate people underneath
- Leadership is about stepping into the unknown and helping others navigate complex environments riddled with ambiguity. From this perspective, a certain degree of naiveness is almost a requirement to be effective.
