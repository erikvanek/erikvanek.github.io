# Vibe Coding & AI-Aided Design

## AI-assisted summary

Vibe coding represents a new paradigm where AI tools like Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt transform digital experience creation, similar to how Squarespace and Wix democratized website building but with fundamentally different implementation approaches. While these tools make "good enough" solutions more accessible, the gap between good and great design continues to provide opportunities for design professionals, as great design remains inherently difficult regardless of technological advances.

The current AI revolution differs from previous shifts by transforming the very nature of design work rather than just making existing tasks easier. For creative exploration, AI's imprecision becomes a feature rather than a bug, creating space between user intent and AI output that enables serendipity and discovery. However, the greatest risk lies in prioritizing speed to such an extent that "good enough" displaces "great," potentially leading to gradual erosion of quality and impact across the design industry.

- AI tools like Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt are changing how we create digital experiences
- we can also view Squarespace and Wix as similar tools but with different implementation as vibe-coding tools
	- These services also allow designers and non-designers to create professional-looking websites with drag-and-drop ease
- Tools might make it easier to make "something good enough" but "great design" remains elusive. Great design is hard
	- gap between good design and great design will always provide opportunities for design professionals
- the **current AI revolution differs fundamentally from these previous shifts**. It's not just about making existing tasks easier—it's about transforming the very nature of how design work will get done.
- for creative tasks and explorations this imprecision isn't a bug. It's THE feature.
	- **The space between what I ask for and what the AI produces creates room for serendipity and discovery**
- **Beware**
	- greatest risk lies in pursuing speed to such an extent that "good enough" displaces "great," leading to a gradual erosion of quality and impact
- It's not AI that will take your job—it's a designer with AI

- Interesting generative arts project by Rick Rubin called [The way of code](https://www.thewayofcode.com/)
