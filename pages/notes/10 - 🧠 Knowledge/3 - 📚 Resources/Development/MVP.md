# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Main Content
An **MVP** is a product that provides just enough value to your users to keep them engaged, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming or difficult to maintain

- MVP = tiny cake but MLP = cupcake, full product is a wedding cake
- emotional value is a need-to-have not a nice-to-have
- the beauty of sharing an incomplete product with others is the opportunity to share it with folks who see unlike yourself
