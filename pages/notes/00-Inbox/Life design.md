	- the perfect day is the one **you remember**
	- days tend to blur better by being objectively different in activities
- senses are time-machines to make days extraordinary
- perfect day is about extracting more experience from each moment from sensory awareness
- same coffee, completely different experience - all because sensory attention
- being more aligned with body state with different routines can help boost efficiency
	- e.g. the best time for workout because of peak body temperature is 3pm
- the perfect day works with circadian rhythms, not agains them
- 17 hour "perfect day formula" based on chronobiology - it is encoded in our biology
	- 2 hours activation after waking and transitioning into full alertness
	- 4-6 hours peak focus - analytical abilities and cognitive peak
	- 4-5 hours - connective phase - best for meeting, collaboration, relationship building
	- 4-5hours - reflection phase - creative insights and big picture thinking emerge
