- shift from designing days around productivity into **designing days around meaningful sensory experiences** which makes days more memorable
	- the perfect day is the one **you remember**
	- days tend to blur better by being objectively different in activities
- senses are time-machines to make days extraordinary
- perfect day is about extracting more experience from each moment from sensory awareness
- same coffee, completely different experience - all because sensory attention
- being more aligned with body state with different routines can help boost efficiency
	- e.g. the best time for workout because of peak body temperature is 3pm
- the perfect day works with circadian rhythms, not agains them
- 17 hour "perfect day formula" based on chronobiology - it is encoded in our biology
	- 2 hours activation after waking and transitioning into full alertness
	- 4-6 hours peak focus - analytical abilities and cognitive peak
	- 4-5 hours - connective phase - best for meeting, collaboration, relationship building
	- 4-5hours - reflection phase - creative insights and big picture thinking emerge
- improve day memorability by 2 sensory interventions
	1. morning sensory environment to engage at least 3 three senses deliberately
		- e.g. gentle wake up sounds, aroma therapy and textured surfaces
	2. one sensory reset point during the day
		   - a 3 minute multi-sensory experience when energy typically dips
			   - e.g. stepping outside to feel sunshine and fresh air while sipping a flavourful beverage
