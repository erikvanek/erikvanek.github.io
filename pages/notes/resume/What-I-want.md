- co-create
- can-do collective
- max 50% sedentary
  - is that realistic?
- preferably in & out environment
- people-oriented while leveraging tech savviness
- learn where I suck
  - inclusivity?
  - dealing with ego beasts?
- **autonomy + mastery + purpose**
- diverse team
  - i.e. like when I started at infarm
- max 4 day work week, preferably 3 day
- travel opportunity and English usage
- contribute to regenerative economics
- mid-long term, no jumping jobs now
- role where I can actively contribute rather then just being the 'dog being wagged'
- focus on _why_ rather than _how_
  - I spent too much time focusing on the latter
- bring the good stuff (what's that? from where?) to local context(s)
  - ideally working on replicable projects
  - mainstreaming / advocating the good stuff
- sweet spot is an organization ~ 20 - 200 people
