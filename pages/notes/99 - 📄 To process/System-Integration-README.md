# Second Brain System Implementation

This README documents the integration of a comprehensive second-brain system into your Obsidian vault.

## What Has Been Done

1. **Folder Structure Creation**
   - Created the main organizational folders:
     - 00-Inbox (for raw captures)
     - 01-Processing (for in-progress notes)
     - 02-RAW (for preserving original notes)
     - 03-Knowledge (for processed, organized content)
     - 06-System (for system documentation)

2. **Domain Organization**
   - Established knowledge domains:
     - Product Management
     - Research
     - Design
     - Productivity
     - Learning

3. **Note Processing**
   - Processed several top-level notes into the structured system:
     - Product Discovery
     - Qualitative Research
     - Productivity
     - Eisenhower Matrix
     - Design Crit
     - Learning
     - Second Brain

4. **Knowledge Maps Creation**
   - Created Maps of Content (MOCs) for domains:
     - ProductManagement-MOC
     - Research-MOC
     - Design-MOC
     - Productivity-MOC
     - Learning-MOC

5. **System Documentation**
   - Created a system guide: [[06-System/second-brain-guide]]

## How to Use This System

1. **Capture new information** in the 00-Inbox folder
2. **Process notes** following the workflow in the system guide
3. **Access knowledge** through the domain MOCs or by searching/filtering
4. **Maintain the system** with regular reviews and reorganization

## Next Steps

1. Process remaining top-level notes
2. Set up templates in the 05-Templates folder
3. Establish regular processing and maintenance routines
4. Use this README as a reference point for system evolution

The detailed system guide can be found at [[06-System/second-brain-guide]].

The original requirements and vision for this system are preserved in [[06-System/Second-brain-master-prompt]].
