	- deliberately under-preparing to avoid finding out you're not any good
	- problem is that it also prevents you finding out you can be great
- motivations
	- #extrensic (driven by image) ^9ad304
		- basically being influcenced/motivated externally ("being perceived by others")
		- focuses on looking good
	- #intrinsic (driven by wanting mastery) ^a845bb
		- pursuing the activity for the sake of enjoying it
		- focuses on getting better
- how to turn insecurity([[#^9ad304]]) into motivation([[#^a845bb]])?
	- 3 ways to tackle/harness imposter
		1. don't agnore insecurities but embrace them well in advance
			- strategic optimism
				- imagine doing something and crushing it
			- defensive pessimism
				- panic upfront but the threat makes people prepare
		2. talk to yourself in 2nd person
			- creates some distance between you and your doubts/insecurities
			- like a boost of confidence from a friend
		3. don't forget to take pride in your achievements
			- can be done by asking questions like "How would your 5/10 years ago version think of you when doing/achieving X?"
- people with imposters tend to be better collaborations, especially men
