the forces of progress are **emotional forces that shape [[Customer]]'s demand**
- Customers experience these emotions all at once

### Demand generation
- push & pull
	- push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel
- **people want to change when they are pushed into discomfort** either internally or externally
	-  e. g. having a second child during shopping i. e. the old way of solving their problems need to change – an example of an external push
- when push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel of the motivation
	- there are **two pull types**
		- an idea of a better life or
		- preference for a particular product
- push and pull can't live without each other
### Demand decrease
- anxiety & inertia
- demand reduction factors are often overlooked – they are just as much a competitor as a competing business
- two types of anxiety
	- anticipatory
		- being afraid of a decision
	- anticipated
		- being afraid of causes a decision brings
		- starts after making a decision
- anxieties are especially important for **first-time customers**
- inertia – the tendency to do nothing and remain unchanged
- **habits play a crucial role when researching for possible inertia**
	- i. e. habits in use and habits in choice
	- e. g. can be tackled by offering an export from a legacy tool to the new one
- old and deeply rooted **habits might prevent one from switching to a competitor** and thus users might start regressing because keeping old habits is easier
- if habits are preventing customers hiring you, then solving for those is an easy win

- **fight anxiety by helping clients visualize** how their life could be if they choose you and **focus on the impact you bring to their life**
	- e. g. looking like a great chef > coal grill features
- **reduce anxiety in choice with trials, discounts or promotions**
- identify any habits in use that might block customers from buying your product
- **comparing the habits of best customers to switchers' is the best way to find out how to make switchers return**
