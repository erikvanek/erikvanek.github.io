- interdependence defines a system i. e. parts influence each other
- a triad between customers, their JTBD and producers
- **4 main parts**
	- the customer imagines a better life situation (new me)
	- the customer searches for and picks a solution
	- the customer uses a solution to mate progress
	- the customer realizes a new me

- innovator's responsibility is to identify why, how and when [[Customer]]s realized they need to change
- in _looking for solutions_ phase is the moment for gathering highest volume of data for customers' JTBD because _[[Customer]]s already have a picture of new me in their minds_ and are trying to figure out how to get there
- goal in this phase is to _figure out why are customers looking (and then buying) for a solution and were not a month ago_, how did they find a solution and what were their hiring criteria and why didn't choose some other solution
- when customers start using a solution, **we must know what they value over competition** so that we can deliver it to them
- when people use your solution – track how (well) are they using it
- typical cycle: survive → stabilize → mature → scale

- similar to PDSA – plan, do, study, act model but it is more circular
- **needs, wants and desired outcomes change when a system changes** and interdependent system change in various ways easily
