- has a zero-sum nature
- competition **should not be restricted to products or services that look and work similarly** e. g. iPod was not dismissed because of a better MP3 player but by a mobile app, same with combustion engines and electric cars
- in order to beat competing solutions, one must give customers a reason to switch from an existing one or hire anew one
- you can claim that something is a competition only after seeing a customer switching between them
- **if you don't have a clear idea of what your clients are going to give up when they start using your product you haven't done enough research** and you're creating a solution no-one will buy
- think of your business as a *system of products* that perpetuates the [[JTBD 1#System of progress]]] forward e. g. an iPhone without Appstore is far less valuable
