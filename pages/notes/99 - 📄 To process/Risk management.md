- essential for a successful PM
# Execution
- we first identify all the uncertain events that may happen in the project
- risks can be both positive (opportunity) and negative (threat) impacts on the project
## Qualitative phase
- then every risk is assigned two abstract values (for example, 1 to 5) to assess the **probability** and **impact** of each risk if it were to occur
	- then you multiply both to get a final score for a given risk
## Quantitative phase
- For all your risks, you **exchange probability to percentage points** (if some incident occurs once in 10 years, and your project is planned for 2, the probability is 20%).
- Then you **exchange impact for money** (or other relevant implact) earned/lost due to the risk
	- e.g. if the risk presents a delay in work for two weeks, you may want to count in all the wages + fees for missing the deadline, for example -500k CZK
- quantitative exposition of the risk is yet again a multiplication of the two numbers
## Planning risks
- plan for the risk response, i.e., what you are going to do about each of the risks
- 3 types of strategies for two types of risks
	- negative
		- Avoid
		- Mitigate
		- Transfer
	- positive
		- Exploit
		- Enhance
		- Share
