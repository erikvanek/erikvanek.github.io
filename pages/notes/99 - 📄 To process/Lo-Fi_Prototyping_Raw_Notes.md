# Raw Transcription of Handwritten Design Research Notes

## Sketching Lo-Fi
- Method of visualization of ideas that support fast/flexible exploration
- As they are pretty lo-fi - a good first stop in prototyping
- Steps: 
  - Sketch on paper or digitally (paper better to be tactile)
  - Use: present sketches to others to get feedback, kickstart discussion, 
    during that you can already work on new sketches
- Research: studio interviews (?), focus groups, concept tests
- Output: lo-fi, raw

## Wizard of Oz approaches aka black boxes
- Manually create responses from ppl/tools through invisible operators ("wizards") behind the scenes. Users are led to believe they're real.
- Prop: Think of the wizard as an invisible puppeteer for service elements, 
  prepare relevant scenography and rig them to allow "wizards" to create realistic responses
- UX: User gets a taste of the prototype. Designer simulates the backend/service 
  UX to evaluate core UX value.
- Research: observation, context, interview
- Output: lo-fi, raw & observations & interview transcripts
