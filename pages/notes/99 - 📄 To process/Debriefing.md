# 4 steps for effective debriefing by HBR
- 1. Schedule a regular time and place
	- make the debrief expected so that everyone can anticipate it
	- the more you debrief, the more effective and efficient the process becomes
- 2. Create a learning environment
	- allow participants to be vulnerable and express weakness
	- results, both good and bad, should be considered team results
- 3. Review 4 key questions
	- What we were trying to accomplish?
		- session should start by restating the objectives we wanted to hit
	- Where did we hit or miss our objectives?
		- Review results and ensure the group is aligned on results
	- What caused our results?
		- root cause analysis should go deeper and try to find why something did (not) happen
		- 5 whys can be a good activity for this
	- What should we start, stop or continue doing?
		- given the root causes uncovered, what does that mean for our plan?
		- what should we do next now we know?
- 4. Codify lessons learnt
	- make sure to capture lessons learnt in a usable format for later reference/use
- Usually the biggest hurdle to debriefing is merely starting it
	- Try to pick small projects and intimate team to pilot the process
