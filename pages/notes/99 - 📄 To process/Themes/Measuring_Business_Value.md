# Measuring Business Value

## Outcomes vs. Impact
- Outcomes (behavior change) → impact (increase in revenue, loyalty...)
- Impact is a side effect of well-designed outcomes
- Leaders think about impact, executors are responsible for outputs and outcome
- Example pathway: impact (reduce cost) → outcome (fewer people calling tech support) → output (improved usability of confusing features)

## Indicators and Metrics
- Leading vs. lagging indicators:
  - Lagging tells you what happened in the past and have limited predictive power
  - Leading indicator has a proven relationship between an action and a result
- Leading indicators show hit or miss the target, lagging indicators reveal the target
- Key results in OKRs are by outcomes - having an outcome (measurable human behavior) almost automatically gives key result definition

## Hypothesis-Driven Approach
- Hypothesis has two parts: the thing we believe in and the evidence we look for to be able to (dis)prove it
- Next step with hypothesis is to define what needs to happen to find out if the hypothesis is right or wrong
- When we state goals with outcomes, we propose some relationship between our work and its results which we can capture in a hypothesis
- Test with an experiment

## Organizational Challenges
- By having well-defined outcomes, it's easier to track progress
- Problem with output-driven teams: they give an illusion of control because they work with fixed feature sets and deadlines
- A basic problem of output-based planning is not knowing what value each feature brings, thus it is hard to prioritize

## Customer Validation (from The Mom Test)
- Major currencies our partners are investing are time, reputation risk and money
- Sometimes strong commitment combines multiple currencies
- Not having a chance to be introduced to other stakeholders is a bad sign
- It's not a real lead until you gave them a concrete chance to reject you
- A meeting succeeded if it has clear next steps defined
