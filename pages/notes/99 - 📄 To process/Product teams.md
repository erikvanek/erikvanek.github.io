- define and solve problems [collaboratively](https://www.svpg.com/beyond-lean-and-agile/) rather than sequentially
	- moved beyond 'product manager defines features' model
- focus on solving problems, **not implementing features**

## Outcome-Based Teams (from Outcomes over Output)
- Teams should focus on outcomes (behavior changes that drive business results) rather than outputs (features)
- In outcome-based work, teams need to be clear about the value they're trying to create
- Teams need a theory that if they create a certain impact for the customer, it will yield a certain outcome for the business
- Output-driven teams give an illusion of control because they work with fixed feature sets and deadlines
- Finished feature â‰  value delivery
- A core challenge: teams are often organized around making stuff, making it hard to focus on cross-functional outcomes
- Trust is a key ingredient for success in adopting outcome-oriented approach
- Earlier engagement between designers and developers is critical to orient work more around outcomes
