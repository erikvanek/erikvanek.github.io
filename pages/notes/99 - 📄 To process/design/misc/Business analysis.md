The goal is to analyze current state of processes used in an organization.

There are two main types:
- as-is
	- analyzing currently used processes
	- says where I am
- to be
	- enhancing the as-is version with changes that need to be done in order to reach new organizational goals
	- says where I want to be
## Tools that can be used
- LucidChart
- BPMN editor (draw.io)
## Process
- Start by compiling a list of all products and services to get a clear outline of the businessâ€™s value chain.
- Then, identify all processes that the company uses to generate those products and services at each level and order them chronologically.
- Be sure to note when each process starts and ends and identify which teams or individuals are involved in (or responsible for) those processes
