- it is the patchwork background that makes [[Service design]] such powerful
- focuses on finding _the right problem_ to solve
	- starts by identifying user needs first
- built on research & testing, not on authority
- no strong pressure on making it right the first time
	- we can evolve & move on towards better solution
- focuses not only on creating value for the customer, but also for surrounding ecosystems
- the process is _not linear_
	- builds on top of deepening, exploratory loops - [[Iteration]]s
- Two main _spaces_, illustrated by [[Double diamond]]
	- Problem
		- Identifying & defining the right problem
	- Solution
		- Developing the right solution to the problem
- not (only) solver customer problems, it designs value propositions, processes & business models
- is:
	- human-centered
		- (internally & externally)
	- collaborative
		- by using stakeholder co-creation
	- iterative
		- exploratory, adaptive & iterative towards implementation
	- sequential
		- visualized and _orchestrated_ as a sequence of interrelated actions
	- real
		- [[Design research|researched]] and [[Prototype|prototyped]] in reality
	- holistic
		- should address the needs of all stakeholders through the entire service across the business
