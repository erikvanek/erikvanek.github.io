- __Thematic analysis is a systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data ta facilitate the discovery of significant themes__
- A systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data from qualitative research
- it is important to _choose a research method that can answer my research question well_
- A rule of thumb - _Analysis can be a lengthy process - budget at least as much time as you had for the data collection to complete it_
- Qualitative data -> Codes -> __Themes__
- Starts with [[Coding]]
- _There's no one way to do TA_
- if possible, include others to the process - during coding, finding themes or drawing insights from them
- gives an answer to the research question by a set of themes
- _use [[Storytelling]] to present a theme_
## Theme
- a description of a belief, practice, need or other phenomenon that is discovered from research data
- when identifying themes make sure they are well backed by the data
## The process
1. get all your data
2. read id E2E
3. code the data
4. identify potential themes
5. __take a break for a day (or more)__
6. evaluate themes and iterate and possibly go to step 3 or 4
