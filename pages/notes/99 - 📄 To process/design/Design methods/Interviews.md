## Customer interviews
- the problem with customer interviews is **that they want to please you** therefore can't be trusted fully
- What helps is to **ask more widely for their [[JTBD 1]]** and their context rather than just on a specific product
	- focus on the question – what is the job your customer is hiring you for?
- we must **understand what customers do and do not know**
	- customers usually know only what system tells and allows then
## JTBD interviews
- **understanding a customer's moment of struggle** can help marketing a solution. It can be even a moment of anxiety that prevents him doing something
- **look for struggle** and energy to tap into when identifying customer jobs or energy and desire to evolve
- after finding the struggle – look for ways how could customers make their lives better
- key is to identify **what they struggle with and what is what they aspire for**
	- like a gap analysis it shows where they are at versus where they want to be
- **start with mapping out demand generators, then blockers**
	- pushes and pulls, then anxiety and inertia
- During interviews rephrase *What job does my product do?”* into **“What job is the customer trying to get done when using the product?”**
- ideal targets are customers who recently bought your product or a similar product from a competitor
- when interviewing customers – they will always offer a solution about a problem they're facing. Leave the solution to them and separate the problem from the solution.
- **The most critical during interviewing is to understand what causes someone to buy something
### Ask about
- what they've done, not what they want
- what other solutions they tried
- what worked and what did not
- what is similar and what is different between those solutions
- how is their life better once they have solved the [[JTBD 1]]
- what makes customers think one solution is better than the other
- How will the customers evolve once their job is solved
- what alternatives have you tours tried before
- at what point they realized current solution was not working anymore
- identity pulls by asking opinions on other products, why did they choose them and how do they compare to each other
- if there is something that blocks you from buying my product
	- if so, what might help to mitigate?
- what budget you're taking away from and how it is managed
- why have leaving clients stopped using your product
- if struggling now, why not last week/month/ year... and what has changed?
- why not choosing other solution? how do they compare to each other?
- what value does current competition deliver?
- once they achieve the new me
	- how does it feel?
	- Did it bring expected outcomes?
	- Did it bring some new aspirations?
### Concrete Questions
- How did you try to solve this before?
- What would your like be like when your job gets done?
