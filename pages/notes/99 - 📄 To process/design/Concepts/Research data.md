- two types:
	- raw
		- transcripts, recordings, photos
	- interpreted
		- filtered through attemps to interpret them e.g. key insights, jobs to be done, user stories
- two "fidelities"
	- assumption-based ^236833
		- as good as contextual knowledge of co-creators
	- research-based ^00343f
		- if done well, should have higher signification than [[#^236833|assumption-based]]
- [[#^236833|assumption-based]] can turn into [[#^00343f|research-based]] as assumptions are challenged & validated
- Qualitative data is _non-numerical_
