- the way how to reduce bias during (not only) [[Design research]] by utilizing different methods and techniques
- types:
	- data triangulation
		- an attempt to more robust data collection by diversifying data formats
			- text, photos, video, artifacts, ...
		- allows for gathering more secondary data later on
	- method triangulation
		- improves (not only) research accuracy and richness by using different methods to cover the same phenomenon
	- research triangulation
		- including various researchers to reduce the bias/subjectivity
