## quotes
- AI rewards designers who show perseverance. Because it’s rarely going to work on the first try. If you don’t genuinely care about what you are building then it’s too easy to give up.
	- _"It has to shake your core to a point where you're not gonna give up”  
	- —_ Meng To

Desining for AI
- https://www.dive.club/ideas/help-wanted-ai-designers
	- designers need to get a new skillset, get to understand what the model capabilities are and think like engineers to be able to deliver people great experience based on AI models
- go on a journey towards becoming an AI-native designer
	- https://www.dive.club/ideas/ai-interface-trends
- [Tim O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/)
	- "In short, there is a whole world of new software to be invented, and it won’t be invented by AI alone but by human programmers using AI as a superpower"
	- "This is not the end of programming. It is the beginning of its latest reinvention."

## Roles
- [Agent engineer](https://sierra.ai/blog/meet-the-ai-agent-engineer)
	- *But getting those agents right is going to be a real challenge. It’s not the programming that’s so hard. It’s **deeply understanding the business processes and thinking how the new capability can transform them to take advantage** of the new capabilities*
