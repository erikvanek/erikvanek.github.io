- also called The cone of plausibility
- created by Joseph Voros to navigate uncertainty & embrace possibility
- categorizing future scenarios into four buckets
	- Probable futures
		- this is where design usually operates
		- what is likely to happen
		- very present-oriented
	- Possible futures
		- what could happen, even if it's difficult to imagine
		- uses fiction as a reflection tool
		- needs a believable series of events that connect even the most extreme situations
	- Plausible futures
		- refers to what could happen
		- space about exploration, not prediction
		- the filter for putting a scenario in this cone is whether various possible futures, including macro forces such as the economy or geopolitics, might allow a business to continue to survive and thrive.
	- Preferred futures
		- where you place the scenarios you want to happen
		- not the answer but where most strategic debates happen
