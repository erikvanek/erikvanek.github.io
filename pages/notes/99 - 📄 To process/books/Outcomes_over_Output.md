# Outcomes over Output

## Core Principles
- An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results
- Outcomes are delivered by changing customer behavior
- Don't mistake making features for being done, which is a legacy from industrial age
- Ideally you want to achieve an outcome by delivering as few features as possible
- Program-logic-model: activities → outputs → outcome → impact
- Managing impact is too abstract; managing outputs might not yield outcome
- We want to manage with outcomes - to ensure that we're driving towards changing customer behavior that brings business results

## Outcomes vs. Outputs
- "What is the customer behavior change we are looking for?"
- When working with outcomes, we need a companion tool - an experiment
- Power combo: outcome-based approach combined with experiments
- E.g. instead of building a well - try out hoses from a river
- MVP is an example of an experiment
- Outcomes (behavior change) → impact (increase in revenue, loyalty...) is a side effect
- Designing for outcomes, when done well, yields impact
- To figure out what desired outcomes (i.e. customer actions that drive business value), we must understand what customers are doing that drives the results we care about

## Implementing Outcome-Based Thinking
- When we state goals with outcomes, we propose some relationship between our work and its results which we can then capture in a hypothesis and test with an experiment
- 3 magic questions:
  1. What are the user and customer actions that drive business results?
  2. How can we make people do more of these actions?
  3. How do we know that we're right?
- Leaders think about impact, executors are responsible for outputs and outcome
- The key is to communicate in desired outcomes and the impact we wish to bring with them
- E.g. impact (reduce cost) → outcome (fewer people calling tech support) → output (improved usability of confusing features)
- By having well-defined outcomes, it's easier to track progress
- Great starting question: "What customer/user/employee behaviors has this initiative created that drives business results?"

## Outcome-Based Planning
- Outcome-based planning is centered around outcome-based roadmap
- Be honest about what you know and don't know and fill in what you don't know by gathering appropriate data
- Roadmaps are supposed to help organizations manage uncertainty - the problem is that they are focused mostly on assumptions and fiction
- Metaphor: planning crossing a desert of an unknown size - filled with unknowns, uncertainty and unknowables
- Promising a roadmap with certainty is really hard to do when we center around outputs - we're promising a certain feature by a certain date
- Plan in terms of outcomes and center roadmap around sets of outcomes
- To do that we must identify a set or a system of outcomes that taken together will create the result you want
- One way to visualize this is to use customer journey maps because it helps to visualize behavior (and behavior relates to outcomes)
- After visualizing - ask "what behaviors at each step predict failure/success" → this helps us to define boosters/blockers
- With this approach - the roadmap is more oriented at questions/hypothesis and filling in blanks/eliminating dead ends

## Organizational Adoption Challenges
- Biggest obstacle for adopting outcomes over outputs is that organizations are often organized around making stuff
- "How could a manager of an iOS team work on an initiative of re-engaging customers?"
- Item detail page - crucial for any e-commerce business: instead of "IDP redesign", reframe as "boost sales by 10% from IDP"
- Instead of talking about a feature set, shift to a desired outcome (impact) an initiative brings
- In outcome-based work, teams need to be clear about the value they are trying to create - they need to know the outcome they deliver to clients/users and to the organization
- You need to have a theory that if you create a certain impact for the customer, it will yield a certain outcome for the business
- E.g. "if we decrease the bounce rate, the users will complete the checkout at a higher rate"
- Problem with output-driven teams is that they give an illusion of control because often they work with fixed feature sets and deadlines
- Finished feature ≠ value delivery
- Instead of focusing on lists of features, we should aim on managing a list of hypotheses with expected metrics connected to them and continuous evaluation
- Trust is a key ingredient for success in adopting outcome-oriented approach
- A basic problem of output-based planning is not knowing what value each feature brings, thus it is hard to prioritize
- Outcome = problem focused, output = solution focused
- Outcomes are hard to think about as they are abstract, features are more concrete
- It's a big fundamental shift and giving up control - people figuring out what to do are no longer people owning the results

## Organizational Implementation
- Outcome-based thinking on organizational level has three pillars:
  1. Your colleagues are your customers - this mindset allows to bridge silos and gaps especially in large organizations
  2. Everything is an outcome
  3. Everything is an experiment
- When thinking about metrics, use framing: "if we were successful with this initiative, what would be different about customer's behavior?"
- When you use outcomes to build your plans, you make progress by running experiments

## The Outcomes Learning Cycle
- Build experiments
- Measure outcomes
- Learn and iterate
