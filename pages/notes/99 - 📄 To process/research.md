"Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge"

## Effective Research Methods

### Customer Interviews (from [[99 - ðŸ“„ To process/books/The_Mom_Test|The Mom Test]])
- The measure of usefulness of early customer interviews is whether they give us facts about customer's lives and world views
- Focus on past behavior, not future intentions - "Talk me through the last time X happened"
- Don't pitch your idea during research - it contaminates the data
- Watch for signals: deep emotions about problems are valuable, compliments and fluff are not
- Banned words that indicate hypothetical situations: would/could/might
- Customer segments are who-where pairs - know exactly who you're targeting and where to find them

### Outcome-Based Research (from [[99 - ðŸ“„ To process/books/Outcomes_over_Output|Outcomes over Output]])
- Research should focus on identifying behaviors that drive business results
- After visualizing customer journeys, ask "what behaviors at each step predict failure/success" 
- This helps define boosters/blockers for desired outcomes
- When thinking about metrics, ask: "if we were successful with this initiative, what would be different about customer's behavior?"
- Research should help develop testable hypotheses about behavior changes
- The learning cycle: Build â†’ Measure outcomes â†’ Learn â†’ Iterate
