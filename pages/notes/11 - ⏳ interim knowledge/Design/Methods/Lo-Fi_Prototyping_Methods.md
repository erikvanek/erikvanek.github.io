# Lo-Fi Prototyping Methods

## Overview
This note details two effective low-fidelity prototyping approaches used in design research: Sketching and Wizard of Oz testing. Both methods enable rapid exploration of ideas and testing of concepts before committing to high-fidelity development.

## Sketching as a Lo-Fi Method

### Description
Sketching is a quick visualization technique that supports fast, flexible exploration of ideas during the early stages of design. The low-fidelity nature makes it an excellent first step in the prototyping process.

### Process
1. **Creation**: 
   - Sketch concepts on paper (preferred for tactile quality) or digitally
   - Focus on speed and quantity rather than quality or detail
   - Capture multiple variations of ideas

2. **Implementation**: 
   - Present sketches to stakeholders and potential users
   - Use as discussion starters to gather initial feedback
   - Facilitate collaborative ideation sessions
   - Iterate on sketches during feedback sessions

3. **Research Applications**:
   - Studio interviews with stakeholders
   - Focus group presentations
   - Concept testing sessions
   - Early-stage design reviews

### Outputs
- Raw sketches (paper or digital)
- Initial feedback documentation
- Identified concept directions
- Refined sketches based on feedback

### Benefits
- Minimal investment of time and resources
- Encourages broad exploration of the solution space
- Lowers the barrier to feedback (people are more comfortable critiquing rough work)
- Enables rapid iteration

## Wizard of Oz Method

### Description
A prototyping approach where human operators ("wizards") manually simulate system functionality behind the scenes while users interact with what appears to be a working system. This creates the illusion of a functioning product without building the actual technology.

### Process
1. **Preparation**:
   - Design the user-facing interface or touchpoint
   - Create the "backstage" operation environment for the wizard
   - Prepare scenography and props to make responses seem realistic
   - Establish protocols for how the wizard should respond to different inputs

2. **Implementation**:
   - User interacts with the prototype
   - Hidden operator/designer provides simulated responses
   - System appears to function autonomously from the user's perspective
   - Designer evaluates core user experience and value proposition

3. **Research Applications**:
   - Contextual observation of user interaction
   - Post-interaction interviews
   - Testing complex functionality before technical development
   - Evaluating service concepts

### Outputs
- Raw observations of user interactions
- Interview transcripts
- Insights about user expectations
- Validation of concept viability

### Benefits
- Tests complex functionality without building it
- Validates core value proposition early
- Reveals user expectations and mental models
- Identifies potential implementation challenges
- Saves development resources on unproven concepts

## Integration with Design Process

Both methods fit within the early exploratory and concept validation phases of the design process. They work well in combination:

1. Begin with sketching to explore multiple concept directions
2. Select promising concepts for more developed testing
3. Create Wizard of Oz prototypes to test interaction and system response
4. Use findings to inform higher-fidelity prototyping and development
