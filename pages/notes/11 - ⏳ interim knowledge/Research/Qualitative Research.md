# Qualitative Research

## Core Characteristics
- _small-n_ research - works with smaller sample sizes
- Not statistically significant - different purpose than quantitative research
- Complementary to quantitative research, not a replacement
- Focuses on understanding "the why" behind problems and root causes
- Aims to gather in-depth insights for informed decision-making

## Common Misconceptions
- Qualitative findings cannot be generalized in the same way as quantitative data
- The goal isn't to disprove hypotheses but to understand problems in detail
- Quantifying qualitative findings ("three of six participants said...") can undermine their value

## Principles of Quality in Qualitative Research

### [[Rules for qualitative rigor]]
1. **Credibility** - confidence in the 'truth' of the findings
2. **Transferability** - showing that the findings have applicability in other contexts
3. **Dependability** - showing that the findings are consistent and could be repeated
4. **Confirmability** - degree of neutrality or extent to which findings are shaped by respondents not researcher bias

*Originally formulated by Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba*

### Elements of Systematic Qualitative Research
- Formulates specific research questions before conducting research
- Carefully samples participants to help deeply understand the subject matter
- Facilitates sessions with open-ended prompts
- Goes beyond opinions to understand underlying motivations
- Analyzes data continuously through coding and interpretation
- Triangulates findings when encountering unusual or extraordinary insights
- Identifies what the problem is (quantitative then determines how significant it is)
- Builds empathetic understanding of users

## Interview Techniques

### Best Practices (from [[The Mom Test]])
- Show genuine interest to encourage openness
- Ask "Talk me through the last time [it] happened" to get concrete examples
- Avoid mentioning your solution too early - focus on their problems first
- Watch for bad data: compliments and hypothetical statements (would/could/might)
- Focus on concrete past behavior rather than hypothetical situations
- Don't prematurely zoom in unless you're sure you're on the right track
- Plan the three most important things to learn from each participant
- Look for people expressing strong emotions about problems - often your best prospects
