# Productivity

## Core Principles

- **James Clear**: "We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. **Productivity is getting important things done consistently**."

## Key Insights

- Consistency is more important than occasional bursts of high output
- Focus on important tasks that move you toward meaningful goals
- Quality of work often matters more than quantity

## Practical Applications

- Prioritizing tasks based on importance rather than urgency
- Creating systems that support consistent progress
