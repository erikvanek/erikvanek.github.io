# Product Discovery

## Core Principles
- Product discovery is all about finding solutions to the business problems we are assigned in our objectives
- Our aim is to **discover** about the problem space ‚Äì then we understand what the problem space is
- If you start with a solution in your mind, there's no point in doing research

## Discovery Process

### Kick-off Workshop
- [Kick off workshop steps](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/discovery-kick-off-workshops/?lm=problem-statements&pt=article):
	- Onboard team ‚Äì decide roles, responsibilities
	- Agree on norms ‚Äì e.g. one hour client facing a week, etc.
	- Define a problem to be solved with a problem statement
	- *Set a goal* ‚Äì what do we want to achieve by the end of the discovery
	- Identify and prioritize unknowns
- Create a research plan to tackle these unknowns

## Discovery Approaches

### Outcome-Driven Discovery (from [[02 - üì© Inbox/Outcomes_over_Output|Outcomes over Output]])
- Focus on outcomes (behavior changes) rather than outputs (features)
- Ask "what are the customer behaviors that drive business results?"
- Plan in terms of outcomes, not features with deadlines
- The 3 magic questions:
  1. What are the user/customer actions that drive business results?
  2. How can we make people do more of these actions?
  3. How do we know that we're right?
- Instead of focusing on lists of features, manage a list of hypotheses with expected metrics
- Example reframe: "IDP redesign" ‚Üí "boost sales by 10% from IDP"
- Roadmaps should be centered around sets of outcomes not feature delivery deadlines
- A basic problem of output-based planning is not knowing what value each feature brings, making prioritization difficult
- Metaphor: Planning with outputs is like promising to cross a desert of unknown size by a specific date

### Continuous Discovery (from [[DESB42_Designove_experimenty|DESB42 Designov√© experimenty]])
- Regular customer feedback gathering and use in product development 
- Reduces the risk of bad decisions
- Helps create products that solve real problems
- Involves a mindset of ongoing learning and adapting

## Research Methods

### Discovery Interviewing (from [[02 - üì© Inbox/The_Mom_Test|The Mom Test]])
- Be genuinely interested in the customer to open their hearts
- Don't mention your idea/solution too soon - focus on their problems first
- Ask "Talk me through the last time [problem] happened" to get concrete examples
- Beware of compliments ("We love it") and hypothetical statements (would/could/might) - they're often fluff
- Plan the three most important things you want to learn from each interview
- Look for customers who express emotion about their problems - they might be your best prospects

## Experimentation

### Framework
- Frame discovery as experiments to test hypotheses

### Designing Experiments (from [[Designove_experimenty_metodika|Designov√© experimenty - metodika]])
- **Operationalization**: Converting general questions into specific measurable metrics
- **Hypothesis formulation**: Consists of a belief statement and evidence we'll look for to confirm/disprove it
- **Selecting appropriate metrics**: Should be relevant, measurable, interpretable, and able to provide actionable insights
- **Experiment types**:
  - Information/interaction design: A/B testing, usability testing, eye-tracking studies
  - Service design: Service prototyping, customer journey testing
  - Behavioral design: Testing nudges, default options, call-to-action variations

### Evaluating Experiments
- **Combine data sources**: Use qualitative (WHY) and quantitative (WHAT) data
- **Consider statistical validity**: Be aware of significance and avoid false positives
- **Use iterative process**: Apply learnings to new iterations
- **Documentation**: Document and share findings with the team

## Application Examples
- Creating a user research plan for feature development
- Setting up an A/B test to validate a hypothesis
- Designing a workshop to align stakeholders on product goals

## Action Items
- Create a standard discovery kick-off workshop template
- Develop a repository of hypothesis templates for common product challenges
- Set up a system for tracking discovery insights across projects
