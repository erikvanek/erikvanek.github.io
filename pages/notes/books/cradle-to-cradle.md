## Notes

- __"The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world"__
- being less bad =/= being good
- latex is one of the key provokers of asthma
- burning waste as a medieval technique, cradle to cradle sees waste as a tool for what's to come
- we are learning that materials have far longer use periods than people expect
- Holland being a pioneer of C2C due to naturual gas-based projects funding
- movie "Waste is food"
- DRIFT institute - a world center for C2C transition management
- "greenification"/replacement of some materials can be just a distraction e.g. tin instead of cadmium when soldering
	- it is less bad, but still toxic
- Titanic, as the ultimate antitC2C example
- Henry Ford's assembly line was inspired by Chicago's beef industry
- Ford also reduced workday 9->8 hours in 1914
- studies reveal that ecosystems are more vulnerable than thought before, business still operate according to paradigms from industrial times
- cradle to grave  - linear, one-way industrial model
	- usually ends with a landfill or incinerator
- problem of __universal design__ e.g. when making soap
	- regions with soft water need less detergant than regions with hard water
	- usually universal design aims to the worst case thus causing more damage than needed
- joke of fictional industrial fashion motto: "If brut force doesn't work, you're not using enough of it"
- brute force leads to uniformity
- 1991 Exxon Valdez actually __increased__ Alaska's GDP
	- GDP was created in times when we thought natural resources are unlimited
	- having only GDP as a metric, any (even harmful) activity increases is
- __"product plus"__ concept
	- something you did not ask for but received with / inside your product (e.g. toxins)
- most industrial methods & materials are unintentionally depletive
	- consequence of unintelligent & outdated design
- __intergenerational remote tyranny__
	- tyranny over future generations through the effects of our actions today 
- recycling being an aspirin to the overconsumering headache
- some trees' leaves in Hamburg contain so heavy concentrations of heavy metals from incinerator fallout that those leaves have to be burned and not composted
- __downcycling__ - reducing the quality of recycled material
- downcycled materials often need additives to make up for its lack of quality
- downcycling  can be also more expensive for bgusiness as it pushes the lifecycle of a material further than it was originally designed for
- Jane Jacobs: "Regulation forces companies to comply under the threat of punishment but they seldom reward for taking initiatives"
	- thus creative problem is rarely encouraged
- the ultimate flaw of "the less bad mindset" is the lack of imagination of better futures
- dioxines are often results of burning polymer materials
- Grimshaw architects bulding a factory for Herman Miller factory as a good C2C example
- __eco-efficient X eco-effective__
	- first tries to save/optimize energy
	- the second is using it wisely
	- analogy can be making things less bad X working on the right things
- __ants and cherry trees make the world a better place :) __
- building roofs are under constant temperature shock
- controlling nature is not only the reigning trend, it has even become an aesthetic preference
	- instead of trying to use nature's abundance (fallen leaves), we try to get it out of the way
- a note to Elon Musk: "If you want a Mars experience, go to live to Chile in a typical copper mine"
- material flows
	- biological - nature can safely decompose and then can be useful for biosphere
	- trechnical - can't be returned to soil and can be useful for technosphere
- (Roman, or every other in general) imperialism emerged in part in response to nutrient loss - timber, food, ...
	- basically trying to look for resources elsewhere
- humans are the only species that take from the soil vast amounts of nutrients but rarely but them back in a usable form
- __right now (2002) we're losing 5000x more soil than it's being developed__
- after post-WWII throwaway products became a norm
- "What if we could design a system that safely captured the phosphate already in circulation (excrements) rather than discarding it as a sludge?"
- with materials it makes sense to celebrate the sameness and commonality rather than trying/needing to have the unique one
- if people are to thrive they need to imitate nature's nutrient flow and metabolism, in which the very concept of waste does not exist
- a concept of "product of service" similar to X as a service
	- e.g. returning a TV after 10 000 viewing hours would allow the provider to upcycle the item after its expected lifespan
	- e.g. rent a solvent - degreasing service for companies would allow for higher quality degreasing instead of buying abundant cheap solvents
- __designing products as products of service means designing them to be disassemblable__
- a good example of natural diversity is 8000 ant species around the planet where each kind firts well into its local conditions
- __Hannover principles__
	- a [set of principles](https://mcdonough.com/writings/the-hannover-principles/) for more sustainable design practice
- the idea of local sustainability is not limited to materials but it begins with them
- sewage + ponds + diverse algae + fish -> C2C system for water purification
- fossiel fuels as a brute force energy supply
- industrial revolution gave people amazing power over nature
- decentralized smaller power supplies (e.g. small shared solars) are more __resilient__ compared to largescale (e.g. nuclear)
- packaging can be enriched with seeds of plants that once thrown away can sproot in nature creating some sort of seed bomb to enrich local ecosystem
- __Question: "What kind of world do we intend, and how might we design things in keeping with that vision?"
- "lotus effect" - nothing sticks to a lotus leaf, is that something to inspire from when making clothes?
- design challenge: __What kind of soap does the river want?__
- __16% of former USSR uninhabitable due to ecocide__
- tripple bottom line - "Ecology, equity and economy"
	- usually focuses on economy and the rest is more of an afterthought
	- tripple top line is when we praise all of them equally
- instead of using nature only as a tool, we can strive to become tools of nature who serve its agenda too
- __ants are effective, not only efficient__
- brownfield - abandoned industrial land
- Ford's Rouge factory as a good example of living in harmony with surrounding ecosystem
- Einstein: __If we're to solve problems that plague us, our thiking must evolve beyond the level, we were using when we caused those problems in the first place__
- __5 steps to eco-effectiveness__ - useful mindset for industrial designers when thking about what to work on next and how to do it well

## Review{#review}

One of the most important books I have read so far. I would call it the bible of upcycling but that would reduce its value and impact.
For me it serves a good predecessor of transition design in a way that it does not leave the planetery and ecological aspect of designing behind. It rather puts it at the core of our thinking and as one of the highest priorities when working on new products. Also its concept of "product of service" seems to be one of the predecessors of _whatever_ as a service that is being coined around a lot around lately.
Probably the most important aspect of the book is the focus on upcycling that really opened my eyes regarding how one can think about that. When we consider upcycling only as an afterthought we'll never get the most of the product we want to upcycle. What happens with a product after it has finished its primary journey needs to be embedded in its initial design. Only this way it can be then reused meaningfully and in the best case in a way, that does not decrease its value in contrast to downcycling.
