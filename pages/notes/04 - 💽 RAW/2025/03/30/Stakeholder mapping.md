# Stakeholder Mapping and Engagement

## AI-assisted summary
Stakeholder mapping is a proactive approach to identifying and engaging with all parties influenced by or affecting a product development process. This systematic practice employs three key strategies: establishing early collaboration to create shared understanding before project initiation, aligning on success metrics to prevent potential conflicts, and actively viewing initiatives through stakeholders' perspectives to accommodate their diverse priorities.

Effective stakeholder management extends beyond direct project participants to include specialized teams focused on compliance and risk management. By incorporating input from safety, privacy, finance, and legal experts early in the development process, teams can identify potential problems before they become critical issues, ultimately creating more robust and sustainable product solutions.
