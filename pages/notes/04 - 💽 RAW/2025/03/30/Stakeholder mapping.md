# Stakeholder Mapping and Engagement

## AI-assisted summary
Stakeholder mapping and engagement are critical components of effective product development, focusing on proactively identifying, analyzing, and collaborating with all parties who may influence or be affected by a project. The approach emphasizes the importance of early collaboration to establish shared understanding, align on metrics to prevent conflicts, and view initiatives through multiple perspectives to accommodate diverse priorities.

A comprehensive stakeholder management strategy must also incorporate specialized input from compliance and risk management teams, including safety, privacy, finance, and legal experts. By engaging these stakeholders early in the process, product teams can identify potential problems before they become critical issues, recognizing that prevention is more efficient than remediation and that these specialized perspectives help create more robust product solutions.
