# Public Administration Innovation Workshop Reflection
## Key Reflection Points

### 1. Most Valuable Insights
Hiring emerged as the most interesting topic but is also the most constrained by practical limitations in the public sector context. Networking and alternative collaboration formats showed the most promise for practical implementation and potential impact. The cross-pollination of ideas across ministries revealed untapped opportunities for collaboration that don't require structural changes.

### 2. Effective Facilitation Techniques
The ability to ask targeted follow-up questions to specific speakers significantly deepened the insights gained. When time allowed for deeper questioning, group engagement visibly increased as participants built on each other's contributions. This highlights the importance of having sufficient time for dialogue rather than just collecting superficial opinions.

### 3. Workshop Challenges
Instructions for the "Jaký krůček můžu udělat zítra" (What small step can I take tomorrow) section lacked clarity, particularly around defining the future impact rather than just describing solutions. This was partly due to last-minute preparation of the templates and verbal instructions. While participants expressed motivation to pursue small, actionable steps, there's uncertainty about whether this reflects genuine commitment or social desirability bias.

### 4. Practical Takeaways
Several concrete ideas emerged with potential for implementation:
- Cross-ministry organizational chart/guidebook to improve navigation of contacts across departments
- Structured collaboration with universities and private sector to bring fresh perspectives
- Using appropriate language that resonates with target audiences rather than internal jargon
- Creating opportunities for informal cross-ministry networking (like hackathons, breakfasts, etc.)

### 5. Format Improvements
For future iterations:
- Allocate uneven time to World Cafe rounds - the first round requires more time for idea generation, while later rounds can focus on refinement
- Reduce time spent re-explaining topics between rounds
- Create clearer instructions for the action planning section
- Consider a designated space for "negative sharing" where participants can express frustrations before returning to a solution-oriented mindset
- Be more intentional about language choices to better fit the target audience
- Allow more time for the second part focused on actionable steps
