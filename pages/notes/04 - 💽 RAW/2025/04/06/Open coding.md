# Open Coding in Qualitative Research

## AI-assisted summary
Open coding, also called inductive or ground-up coding, is a fundamental qualitative data analysis approach where researchers break down information into small segments and derive codes organically from the data itself rather than imposing predetermined categories. This method allows researchers to identify and label meaningful patterns without preconceptions, creating space for unexpected insights to emerge.

As the initial phase in many qualitative analysis frameworks, open coding is particularly valuable for exploratory research where researchers aim to understand phenomena without testing specific hypotheses. The process involves examining data line-by-line or paragraph-by-paragraph, labeling meaningful segments with descriptive codes, then gradually refining these codes as analysis progresses. This bottom-up approach ensures that the resulting narrative and theoretical understanding genuinely reflects the data's inherent meaning rather than researcher assumptions, making it especially appropriate for investigating new or poorly understood topics.
