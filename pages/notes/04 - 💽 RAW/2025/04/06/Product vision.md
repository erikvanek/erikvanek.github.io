# Product Vision Development

- Admittedly, a good product vision is a bit of an art form, as fundamentally it is a _persuasion tool_.
- "When done well, the product vision is _compelling_, _inspiring_, and _empowering_‚Äîleaving the product teams feeling excited to begin the hard work of making this vision a reality."
- Google was using this vision statement when it was kickstarting their activities: "Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
- Good example of company vision and restructuring priorities in [Josh Miller's tweet](https://x.com/joshm/status/1850717644779110643) on why they're putting Arc on ice
	- and [new vision of Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/) soon
- Manifestos are good examples of persuasive visions
- A good vision is thought-provoking, inspiring, memorable and concrete
