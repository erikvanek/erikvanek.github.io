# Axial Coding

## AI-assisted summary
Axial coding is a qualitative research technique that helps researchers identify significant patterns in their data by organizing previously generated open codes around central themes or "axes" relevant to their research questions. The process begins after open coding has produced a collection of seemingly discrete codes that may initially appear disconnected from one another.

During axial coding, researchers examine relationships between these individual codes to recognize broader patterns and common elements, ultimately establishing overarching themes that represent key concepts for the analysis. These identified axes serve as organizational frameworks that bring coherence to the data, advancing the researcher toward meaningful theory generation by moving from fragmented observations to cohesive, significant themes that address the original research questions.

- before doing axial coding you should have a set of open codes, that have seemingly little to do with each other
	- they might be very discrete
- _the process of identifying larger themes relevant to your research question_
- those themes define the 'axes' around which the codes can be organized
- axial code represents a potentially key theme that might be significant to your data analysis and theory generation
