# Closed Coding in Qualitative Research

## AI-assisted summary
Closed coding, also known as deductive or top-down coding, is a qualitative research approach where researchers begin with a predetermined coding framework developed before data analysis based on existing theories, literature, or specific research questions. This method contrasts with open coding by imposing structure on the analysis process from the outset rather than allowing codes to emerge organically from the data.

This approach is particularly valuable when researchers have clear expectations about their findings or when testing established theories in new contexts. The process involves creating a codebook that defines the categories and criteria for classification, then systematically applying these predefined codes to the data. Closed coding offers greater consistency and efficiency in analysis but may potentially miss unexpected themes or insights that don't fit within the predetermined framework.

- also called deductive or top-down coding
- starts with developing a [[Codebook]] based on research question
- useful when you have pre-defined how your findings should look like
