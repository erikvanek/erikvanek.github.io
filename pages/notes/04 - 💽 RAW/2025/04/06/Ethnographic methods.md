# Ethnographic Methods

- Nicely described [here](https://medium.com/idinsight-blog/the-case-for-iteration-in-qualitative-research-design-e07ed1314756) 
	- Contextual interviews
	- Diary studies
	- Building trust between researcher and participant is essential to avoid the "observer effect"
	- Observation
		- Participation
			- Active X passive observation
			- Asking questions and probing during active, remaining silent during passive
			- _"While observing participants, researchers should take notes 3 main notes about activities: what participant do, what participants say during the experience if they are asked by the researcher and how researchers interpret those situations."_
		- Non-participation
			- Being like a "fly on the wall"
