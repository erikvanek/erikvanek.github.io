# System of Progress

## AI-assisted summary
The System of Progress framework describes how customers move through a dynamic cycle of transformation when adopting products or services to improve their lives. This system is defined by the interdependence between customers, their Jobs To Be Done (JTBD), and producers, with each component influencing the others in a continuous cycle of development and adaptation.

The framework outlines four key phases: first, customers imagine a better life situation (the "new me"); second, they search for and select potential solutions; third, they use the chosen solution to make progress; and finally, they realize the "new me" state. For product innovators, understanding the triggers that initiate this cycle and the criteria customers use when evaluating solutions is crucial, particularly during the "looking for solutions" phase when customers have already envisioned their desired outcome. As users move through these stages, their needs and desired outcomes evolve within the interdependent system, creating ongoing opportunities for product refinement and innovation.

- Interdependence defines a system i.e. parts influence each other
- A triad between customers, their JTBD and producers
- **4 main parts**
	- The customer imagines a better life situation (new me)
	- The customer searches for and picks a solution
	- The customer uses a solution to make progress
	- The customer realizes a new me

- Innovator's responsibility is to identify why, how and when [[Customer]]s realized they need to change
- In _looking for solutions_ phase is the moment for gathering highest volume of data for customers' JTBD because _[[Customer]]s already have a picture of new me in their minds_ and are trying to figure out how to get there
- Goal in this phase is to _figure out why are customers looking (and then buying) for a solution and were not a month ago_, how did they find a solution and what were their hiring criteria and why didn't choose some other solution
- When customers start using a solution, **we must know what they value over competition** so that we can deliver it to them
- When people use your solution â€“ track how (well) are they using it
- Typical cycle: survive â†’ stabilize â†’ mature â†’ scale

- Similar to PDSA â€“ plan, do, study, act model but it is more circular
- **Needs, wants and desired outcomes change when a system changes** and interdependent system change in various ways easily
