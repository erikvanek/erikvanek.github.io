# System of Progress

## AI-assisted summary
The System of Progress framework describes the interdependent cycle through which customers transform their lives by adopting products or services. This system consists of four sequential phases: customers first imagine a better situation ("new me"), then search for and select solutions, use their chosen solution to make progress, and finally realize their transformed state, completing the cycle that connects customers, their Jobs To Be Done, and producers.

For product innovators, this framework offers strategic insight into customer behavior at each phase, particularly during the "looking for solutions" stage when customers have already formed a vision of their desired outcome. By understanding what triggers customers to seek change, what criteria they use to evaluate options, and what they value over competing solutions, businesses can more effectively meet evolving needs. As customers progress through the cycle from survival to scaling, their needs and desired outcomes continuously evolve within this interdependent system.

- Interdependence defines a system i.e. parts influence each other
- A triad between customers, their JTBD and producers
- **4 main parts**
	- The customer imagines a better life situation (new me)
	- The customer searches for and picks a solution
	- The customer uses a solution to make progress
	- The customer realizes a new me

- Innovator's responsibility is to identify why, how and when [[Customer]]s realized they need to change
- In _looking for solutions_ phase is the moment for gathering highest volume of data for customers' JTBD because _[[Customer]]s already have a picture of new me in their minds_ and are trying to figure out how to get there
- Goal in this phase is to _figure out why are customers looking (and then buying) for a solution and were not a month ago_, how did they find a solution and what were their hiring criteria and why didn't choose some other solution
- When customers start using a solution, **we must know what they value over competition** so that we can deliver it to them
- When people use your solution â€“ track how (well) are they using it
- Typical cycle: survive â†’ stabilize â†’ mature â†’ scale

- Similar to PDSA â€“ plan, do, study, act model but it is more circular
- **Needs, wants and desired outcomes change when a system changes** and interdependent system change in various ways easily
