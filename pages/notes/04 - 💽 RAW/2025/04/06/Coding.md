# Qualitative Research Coding Methods

## AI-assisted summary
Qualitative research coding is a systematic method for identifying, categorizing, and labeling important concepts within data to reveal underlying patterns and human narratives. The process follows a structured progression: reviewing research questions, identifying key concepts, conducting preliminary review, defining initial code structures, and applying the framework while modifying it as needed throughout the analysis.

The coding workflow typically includes multiple rounds: initial coding to segment data, organizing codes into categories, subsequent refinement passes, and ultimately developing a coherent narrative from the patterns discovered. Most research employs a mix of approaches (selective, axial, open, or closed coding) alongside best practices like maintaining a codebook and using both descriptive codes (labeling content) and interpretive codes (adding analytical perspective).

- can be [[Selective coding]], [[Axial coding]], [[Open coding]] or [[Closed coding]]
	- usually a mix of them
	- more niche - focused coding, theoretical coding, thematic coding, ...
- _a process of systematically identifying, categorizing and labeling important ideas with appropriate codes_
- can be useful to establish a [[Codebook]]
- it helps to find human stories behind the data
- the process varies depending on a research goal
## Code selection
- review the research question to ensure the codes suit it
- identify key concepts and phenomena relevant to the research question
- conduct a preliminary data review to identify initial themes and topics
- define initial code structure to suit the research goal while allowing new to codes to be added along the way
- apply initial framework to the data
- modify (add, merge, split, ...) as you go based on project needs
- ensure consistency
## Coding steps
- first round pass of coding
- organize codes into categories and subcodes
- do further rounds of coding - reanalyzing, finding patterns
- turn codes and findings into final narrative
- slowly reducing the number of codes and narratives emerging
- 
## Best prectices
- use a [[Codebook]] to keep track of codes
- capture positive and negative aspects of a phenomena
## Code
- represents data like a keyword represents an article
- a word or phrase that acts as a lable for a segment of text
	- a shorthand for more complicated information
	- types:
		- Descriptive
			- They describe what the data is about
		- Interpretive
			- Analytical reading of the data, adding researcher's interpretation
