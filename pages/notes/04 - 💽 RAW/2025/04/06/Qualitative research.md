# Qualitative Research

## AI-assisted summary
Qualitative research is a small-sample methodology focused on understanding the "why" behind problems rather than proving hypotheses or achieving statistical significance. This approach complements quantitative methods by providing deep insights into user problems, behaviors, and motivations that inform decision-making when statistical generalization isn't possible or necessary.

To maintain rigor and trustworthiness, qualitative research must meet four key criteria established by Lincoln and Guba: credibility (truth of findings), transferability (applicability in other contexts), dependability (consistency), and confirmability (neutrality from researcher bias). These standards are achieved through systematic practices including specific research questions, careful participant selection, open-ended prompts, motivation-focused inquiry, continuous data analysis, and triangulation to validate unusual observations.

- _small-n_ research
- it is _not_ statistically significant
- we can't generalize from small sample sizes, it is _just different_ than quantitative research
	- it is a complement to qualitative research
	- the goal isn't to disprove hypothesis, we're looking to understand the problem in detail
- _helps to understand 'the why' behind the problem and its possible root causes_, qualitative research would only allow us to speculate
- the goal is to gather insights to make informed decisions later
- by quantification in our analysis we're opening ourselves up to a quantitative judgement
	- "three of six" kind of statements can be easily disregarded
## [[Rules of qualitative rigor|Rules for qualitative rigor]] 
1. Credibility - confidence in the 'truth' of the findings
2. Transferability - showing that the findings have applicablity in other contexts
3. Dependability - showing that the findings are consistent and could be repeated
4. Confirmability - a degree of neutraility or the extent to which the findings of a study are shaped by the respondents and not researcher bias, motivation, or interest.
- done by Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba
- we can satisfy those by being _systematic_
## Systematic qualitative research
- formulates a specific _research question before research_ is conducted
- samples carefully by recruiting participants to help to deeply understand the subject matter
- facilitates research sessions with _open-ended prompts_
- does not take only opinions but _tries to understand 'the why'_ behind them
- _analyzes the data continuously_ by coding and concluding from the data
- __attempts to triangulate__ when facing something extraordinary or unusual to ensure that our conclusions are supported by data
- says what the problem is, quantitative says how bad it is
- helps to build an empathetic understanding of our users

## Interview Best Practices (from The Mom Test)
- Be genuinely interested about people to open their hearts
- "Talk me through the last time [it] happened" is a great question for promoting show-don't-tell
- The big mistake is to mention your idea too soon rather than too late
- Watch out for bad data: compliments and fluff
  - Banned words: would/could/might - these indicate hypothetical situations
  - Fight fluff by asking about concrete past behavior
- Don't prematurely zoom in unless you're sure you're zooming into the right thing
- Plan the three most important things you want to learn from each person
- Look for people expressing deep emotion about problems - they're often your best prospects
