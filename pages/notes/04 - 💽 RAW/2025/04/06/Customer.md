# Customer Understanding

## AI-assisted summary
Customer understanding hinges on the fundamental principle that people don't buy products for their features but to make progress in their lives. Rather than complaining, dissatisfied customers typically switch providers silently, and there's often a significant disconnect between what people say they want and what they actually do in practice (evidenced by companies like Ryanair that have poor brand perception yet strong growth).

The Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework conceptualizes needs as dynamic interactions between customers, their desire for progress, and the products they "hire" to achieve this progress. This perspective shifts focus from activities to outcomes, recognizing that needs evolve rather than being inherent to customers. For successful product adoption, companies must either outperform existing solutions or influence customers to redefine their jobs, creating new demand.

- Great advertising speaks to the customer's struggling moment
## Behavior
- A dissatisfied customer does not complain, he just switches
- Customers **don't care about features of a product but if it helps** then get closer to getting their job done
- **When you design for a specific outcome, customers leave once the outcome is achieved**; when designing for improving customer's live, then it never ends
- **People don't buy things just to have them**, but they want to make their lives better i.e. make progress
- There must be a true desire for change in order to hire a product or a service
- **People say â‰  people do** e.g. Ryanair is one of the worst brands but the company grows rapidly
- What people are doing is not the same as what they are trying to accomplish
	- Focusing on the **outcome** rather than on a given activity that needs to happen
- Using a product/service starts with hiring -> using -> firing

## Needs
- Needs and wants change in time and do not belong to the customer
- A need represents **an interaction between the customer, their desire for Progress, and the product they hired for [[JTBD 1]]**
- "Customer wants" come from the system, not from customers
	- If you want to persuade customers to use your product you either have to outcompete a current solution, or make the customer change their [[JTBD 1]] thus want a new solution
- Unmet [[Goal]] is a future experience a [[Customer]] wants, but can't get at the moment
