# Research Planning

## AI-assisted summary
Effective research planning requires careful consideration of multiple dimensions including iterative research loops, appropriate sampling strategies, and methodology selection. The process should embrace emergent samplingâ€”following unexpected leads during fieldworkâ€”while maintaining awareness of research biases and contextual factors that might influence results, continuing until theoretical saturation is reached when additional data no longer provides new insights.

A comprehensive research plan combines multiple approaches to ensure triangulation and methodological robustness. This typically includes desk research to leverage existing knowledge, ethnographic methods for observing participants in natural settings, participant approaches like interviews and focus groups, non-participant methods such as observation and cultural probes, and co-creative workshops. The guiding principle is to begin with desired outcomes rather than predetermined methods, which allows for maximal flexibility and discovery throughout the research process.

## Research planning
- Includes research loops, sample size & selection & [[Design methods]] selection
- _Research loops are a tool to iterate_
- Don't forget about [[Triangulation]]
- When deciding sample selection - beware of research bias
- _Emergent sampling_
	- Follow new leads during fieldwork as they unfold, leverage flexibly new knowledge
	- I.e. when you find something interesting, don't ignore it
- Beware of research context
	- E.g. when researching train station service
		- What kind of people you need at train station during different day times
- It is useful to engage with participants in their natural surroundings
- When more research only confirms already identified patterns, [theoretical saturation is reached](https://dovetail.com/research/data-saturation/), then it is possible to [iterate](https://medium.com/idinsight-blog/the-case-for-iteration-in-qualitative-research-design-e07ed1314756)
- Research types
	- Overt
		- You are open with your intent
		- Inherently biased with "the observer effect"
	- Covert
		- Your intent is hidden
		- Ethically problematic
- A good method mix combines each of:
	- [[Desk research]]
		- Before or in parallel - try to go through some [[Secondary research]]
		- Try to maximize the learning from secondary research as it is cheaper than conducting research on your own
	- [[Self-ethnographic research]]
	- [[Ethnographic methods]]
	- [[Participant approach]]
		- Interviews, observation, focus groups
	- Non-participant approaches
		- Non-participant observation, cultural probes, co-creating
	- Co-creative workshops
		- Journey maps, system maps, co-creating personas
		- Great workshop ideas in [this](https://dovetail.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right/) article to kick start the research scope
- Check a [Design Research Framework](https://www.muledesign.com/blog/design-research-framework) by Erika Hall to see what could work for you
- Don't start with methods but with outcome - if you start with methods, you can limit your options
