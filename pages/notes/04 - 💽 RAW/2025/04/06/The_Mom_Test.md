# The Mom Test

## AI-assisted summary
The Mom Test provides a framework for conducting effective customer interviews that reveal true insights rather than misleading validation. The approach is founded on a simple principle: ask about the customer's life and problems rather than their opinions about your ideaâ€”since even well-meaning people (like your mother) will offer overly positive feedback when directly asked about a business concept.

The method emphasizes several practical techniques for obtaining honest, valuable feedback: focusing on specific past behaviors rather than hypothetical futures, avoiding premature solution discussions, recognizing and filtering out compliments and vague responses, and planning interviews with clear learning objectives. Effective customer validation requires looking for concrete commitment signals (time, reputation risk, money) and narrowing customer segments into specific, findable slices rather than trying to serve everyone immediately.

## Core Principles
- Be genuinely interested about the people to open their hearts
- The measure of usefulness of early customer interviews is whether they give us facts about our customer's lives and world views
- The big mistake is to mention your idea too soon rather than too late
- "Talk me through the last time [it] happened" is a great question promoting show don't tell
- Customers own the problem, builders own the solution

## Handling Customer Feedback
- Beware of bad data: compliments and fluff
  - Compliments: "We love it..."
  - Fluff: generic claims ("I always/never..."), future promises ("I would/will"), hypotheticals ("I might/could")
- Fight fluff by asking about the last time they did something or how they tried to solve it
- Most fluffy thing: "I would buy that"
- Banned verbs: would/could/might
- Cut down fluff by anchoring to the real
- "There might be an easier way of helping you achieve X" as a reframe for feature requests
- We're searching for the truth, not to be right
- Don't prematurely zoom in unless you're pretty sure you're zooming into the right thing

## Interview Planning & Execution
- Plan what are the most important three things you want to learn from each person
- When snowballing, start with friendly first contacts
- Formal setup might decrease the chance for serendipitous learning
- If it feels like they're doing you a favor by talking to you, it's probably too formal
- The duration of formal B2B interviews is mostly determined by the arbitrary length of a calendar block - what we came for is usually achieved within 20 minutes
- A meeting succeeded if it has clear next steps defined in order to move progress further
- Ending the meeting with a rejection of next steps is not necessarily a failure but a negative data point - the real failure is not even asking for further progress

## Customer Qualification
- Major currencies our partners are investing are time, reputation risk and money
- Sometimes strong commitment combines multiple currencies
- Not having a chance to be introduced to other stakeholders is a bad sign
- It's not a real lead until you gave them a concrete chance to reject you
- Look for "This is the worst part of my life and you can help me fix it" as those might be most prospective clients
- When you see a deep emotion - make sure to keep those people close to you
- The goal of early stages is learning, revenue is a side-effect
- The goal of cold conversations is to stop having them

## Interview Format
- The only thing people love talking more about than themselves is to talk about their problems
- Ask for an interview format: Vision â†’ Framing â†’ Weakness â†’ Pedestal â†’ Help
- Helps to set appropriate expectations when arranging to talk to someone that might be hard to get
- What I aim to do â†’ where I'm at right now â†’ What am I missing now â†’ what can you help with â†’ Ask for help
- Make them stars of the show

## Customer Segmentation
- Customer segmentation as a tool not to drown in a myriad of options
- Before we can serve everyone, we must serve someone
- Customer slicing - the act of narrowing down customer profile based on our continuous learning
- Once we know what is our slice, the next question to have an answer to is where to find these people
- Customer segments are who-where pair
- It's good to know what commitment and next steps are expected at the end of the interview
- The point of desk research is to find answers to the obvious
- If you don't know why you're having a conversation, you should not bother having it
- Having some symbols to illustrate common situations like pain, opportunity... can be handy
