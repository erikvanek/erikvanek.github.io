# Life Design Through Sensory Experiences

## AI-assisted summary
Life design shifts focus from productivity metrics to creating memorable days through deliberate sensory engagement. This approach suggests that our most valuable days aren't those filled with completed tasks but rather those we can vividly remember‚Äîachieved by crafting objectively different experiences and heightening sensory awareness during everyday moments.

The framework integrates chronobiology principles to structure a 17-hour "perfect day" aligned with natural rhythms: morning activation (2 hours), peak cognitive focus (4-6 hours), connection and collaboration (4-5 hours), and reflective thinking (4-5 hours). Two key sensory interventions enhance day memorability: creating morning environments engaging at least three senses simultaneously and implementing brief multi-sensory resets during energy dips. Specific sensory tools include rosemary for alertness, lavender for creative problem-solving, and citrus for morning routines.

- shift from designing days around productivity into **designing days around meaningful sensory experiences** which makes days more memorable
	- the perfect day is the one **you remember**
	- days tend to blur better by being objectively different in activities
- senses are time-machines to make days extraordinary
- perfect day is about extracting more experience from each moment from sensory awareness
- same coffee, completely different experience - all because sensory attention
- being more aligned with body state with different routines can help boost efficiency
	- e.g. the best time for workout because of peak body temperature is 3pm
- the perfect day works with circadian rhythms, not agains them
- 17 hour "perfect day formula" based on chronobiology - it is encoded in our biology
	- 2 hours activation after waking and transitioning into full alertness
	- 4-6 hours peak focus - analytical abilities and cognitive peak
	- 4-5 hours - connective phase - best for meeting, collaboration, relationship building
	- 4-5hours - reflection phase - creative insights and big picture thinking emerge
- improve day memorability by 2 sensory interventions
	1. morning sensory environment to engage at least 3 three senses deliberately
		- e.g. gentle wake up sounds, aroma therapy and textured surfaces
	2. one sensory reset point during the day
		   - a 3 minute multi-sensory experience when energy typically dips
			   - e.g. stepping outside to feel sunshine and fresh air while sipping a flavourful beverage
# Scents
- rosemary increases alertness and memory - good for focus work
- lavender improves creative problem solving - good for creative and reflective times
- citrus essences during morning routine
