# Life Design Through Sensory Experiences

## AI-assisted summary
Life design represents a paradigm shift from productivity-focused days to experience-oriented living that enhances day memorability through deliberate sensory engagement. This approach suggests that the most valuable days aren't measured by tasks completed but by our ability to remember them‚Äîachieved by creating objectively different activities and heightening sensory awareness during routine moments.

The framework incorporates chronobiology (the study of natural biological rhythms) to structure a 17-hour "perfect day" aligned with circadian patterns: two hours of morning activation, 4-6 hours of peak cognitive focus, 4-5 hours for connection and collaboration, and 4-5 hours for reflective thinking. To enhance day memorability, the approach recommends two key sensory interventions: creating morning environments that engage at least three senses simultaneously (like combining gentle sounds with aromatherapy and textured surfaces) and implementing a brief multi-sensory reset during energy dips. Specific sensory tools include rosemary scent for alertness, lavender for creative problem-solving, and citrus essences for morning routines‚Äîall working to transform ordinary experiences into memorable ones through heightened sensory attention.

- shift from designing days around productivity into **designing days around meaningful sensory experiences** which makes days more memorable
	- the perfect day is the one **you remember**
	- days tend to blur better by being objectively different in activities
- senses are time-machines to make days extraordinary
- perfect day is about extracting more experience from each moment from sensory awareness
- same coffee, completely different experience - all because sensory attention
- being more aligned with body state with different routines can help boost efficiency
	- e.g. the best time for workout because of peak body temperature is 3pm
- the perfect day works with circadian rhythms, not agains them
- 17 hour "perfect day formula" based on chronobiology - it is encoded in our biology
	- 2 hours activation after waking and transitioning into full alertness
	- 4-6 hours peak focus - analytical abilities and cognitive peak
	- 4-5 hours - connective phase - best for meeting, collaboration, relationship building
	- 4-5hours - reflection phase - creative insights and big picture thinking emerge
- improve day memorability by 2 sensory interventions
	1. morning sensory environment to engage at least 3 three senses deliberately
		- e.g. gentle wake up sounds, aroma therapy and textured surfaces
	2. one sensory reset point during the day
		   - a 3 minute multi-sensory experience when energy typically dips
			   - e.g. stepping outside to feel sunshine and fresh air while sipping a flavourful beverage
# Scents
- rosemary increases alertness and memory - good for focus work
- lavender improves creative problem solving - good for creative and reflective times
- citrus essences during morning routine
