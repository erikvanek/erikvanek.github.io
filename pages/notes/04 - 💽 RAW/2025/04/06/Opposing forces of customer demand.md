# Opposing Forces of Customer Demand

## AI-assisted summary
The Opposing Forces of Customer Demand model describes the four key emotional forces that simultaneously influence customer purchasing decisions. Two forces generate demand: "push" (dissatisfaction with current solutions) creates the initial trigger for change, while "pull" (attraction to better alternatives) steers customers toward specific solutions. Counterbalancing these are two forces that reduce demand: "anxiety" (fears about change outcomes) and "inertia" (resistance to abandoning established habits).

Understanding these forces provides critical insights for product strategy by revealing opportunities to address each component. Effective approaches include helping customers visualize positive outcomes to combat anxiety (both pre-decision fear and anticipated consequences) and identifying specific habits that block adoption. The model recognizes that demand reduction factors are as significant as direct competitors, with habits playing a crucial role in both preventing new product adoption and causing customers to abandon products they've tried.

### Demand generation
- Push & pull
	- Push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel
- **People want to change when they are pushed into discomfort** either internally or externally
	- E.g. having a second child during shopping i.e. the old way of solving their problems need to change â€“ an example of an external push
- When push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel of the motivation
	- There are **two pull types**
		- An idea of a better life or
		- Preference for a particular product
- Push and pull can't live without each other
### Demand decrease
- Anxiety & inertia
- Demand reduction factors are often overlooked â€“ they are just as much a competitor as a competing business
- Two types of anxiety
	- Anticipatory
		- Being afraid of a decision
	- Anticipated
		- Being afraid of causes a decision brings
		- Starts after making a decision
- Anxieties are especially important for **first-time customers**
- Inertia â€“ the tendency to do nothing and remain unchanged
- **Habits play a crucial role when researching for possible inertia**
	- I.e. habits in use and habits in choice
	- E.g. can be tackled by offering an export from a legacy tool to the new one
- Old and deeply rooted **habits might prevent one from switching to a competitor** and thus users might start regressing because keeping old habits is easier
- If habits are preventing customers hiring you, then solving for those is an easy win

- **Fight anxiety by helping clients visualize** how their life could be if they choose you and **focus on the impact you bring to their life**
	- E.g. looking like a great chef > coal grill features
- **Reduce anxiety in choice with trials, discounts or promotions**
- Identify any habits in use that might block customers from buying your product
- **Comparing the habits of best customers to switchers' is the best way to find out how to make switchers return**
