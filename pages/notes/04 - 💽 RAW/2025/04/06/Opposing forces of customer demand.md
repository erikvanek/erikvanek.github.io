# Opposing Forces of Customer Demand

## AI-assisted summary
The Opposing Forces of Customer Demand model describes the emotional forces that simultaneously shape customer decision-making when considering whether to adopt a new product or service. These forces work in opposing pairs: "push" (dissatisfaction with current situation) and "pull" (attraction to a better solution) generate demand, while "anxiety" (fears about changes) and "inertia" (resistance to changing established habits) reduce demand.

Understanding these forces provides crucial insights for product development and marketing strategy. Push factors serve as triggers that create discomfort with the status quo, while pull factors steer customers toward specific solutions. Simultaneously, businesses must address anxiety (both anticipatory fear before decisions and anticipated concerns about consequences) and overcome inertia (especially habit-related resistance). Effective strategies include helping customers visualize positive outcomes to combat anxiety and identifying specific habits that might block adoption, with particular attention to differences between loyal customers and those who tried but abandoned the product.

### Demand generation
- Push & pull
	- Push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel
- **People want to change when they are pushed into discomfort** either internally or externally
	- E.g. having a second child during shopping i.e. the old way of solving their problems need to change â€“ an example of an external push
- When push is the trigger, pull is the steering wheel of the motivation
	- There are **two pull types**
		- An idea of a better life or
		- Preference for a particular product
- Push and pull can't live without each other
### Demand decrease
- Anxiety & inertia
- Demand reduction factors are often overlooked â€“ they are just as much a competitor as a competing business
- Two types of anxiety
	- Anticipatory
		- Being afraid of a decision
	- Anticipated
		- Being afraid of causes a decision brings
		- Starts after making a decision
- Anxieties are especially important for **first-time customers**
- Inertia â€“ the tendency to do nothing and remain unchanged
- **Habits play a crucial role when researching for possible inertia**
	- I.e. habits in use and habits in choice
	- E.g. can be tackled by offering an export from a legacy tool to the new one
- Old and deeply rooted **habits might prevent one from switching to a competitor** and thus users might start regressing because keeping old habits is easier
- If habits are preventing customers hiring you, then solving for those is an easy win

- **Fight anxiety by helping clients visualize** how their life could be if they choose you and **focus on the impact you bring to their life**
	- E.g. looking like a great chef > coal grill features
- **Reduce anxiety in choice with trials, discounts or promotions**
- Identify any habits in use that might block customers from buying your product
- **Comparing the habits of best customers to switchers' is the best way to find out how to make switchers return**
