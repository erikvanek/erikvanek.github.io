# Research Data Types and Fidelities

- Two types:
	- Raw
		- Transcripts, recordings, photos
	- Interpreted
		- Filtered through attempts to interpret them e.g. key insights, jobs to be done, user stories
- Two "fidelities"
	- Assumption-based ^236833
		- As good as contextual knowledge of co-creators
	- Research-based ^00343f
		- If done well, should have higher signification than [[#^236833|assumption-based]]
- [[#^236833|Assumption-based]] can turn into [[#^00343f|research-based]] as assumptions are challenged & validated
- Qualitative data is _non-numerical_
