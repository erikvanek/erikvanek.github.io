# Research Data Types and Fidelities

## AI-assisted summary
Research data in product development can be categorized by both type and fidelity, creating a framework for understanding the relative value and reliability of different information sources. The two primary types are raw data (unfiltered direct observations like transcripts, recordings, and photos) and interpreted data (information that has been processed through analytical frameworks to extract insights, jobs to be done, or user stories).

In terms of fidelity, research data exists on a spectrum from assumption-based (derived from team members' contextual knowledge and hypotheses) to research-based (systematically collected through formal research methods). While assumption-based data can be quickly generated, its reliability depends entirely on the team's existing knowledge, whereas properly collected research-based data typically provides higher confidence. The product development process often involves transforming assumption-based information into research-based knowledge as initial hypotheses are validated or challenged through systematic investigation.

- Two types:
	- Raw
		- Transcripts, recordings, photos
	- Interpreted
		- Filtered through attempts to interpret them e.g. key insights, jobs to be done, user stories
- Two "fidelities"
	- Assumption-based ^236833
		- As good as contextual knowledge of co-creators
	- Research-based ^00343f
		- If done well, should have higher signification than [[#^236833|assumption-based]]
- [[#^236833|Assumption-based]] can turn into [[#^00343f|research-based]] as assumptions are challenged & validated
- Qualitative data is _non-numerical_
