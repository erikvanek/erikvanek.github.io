# Interaction Design

## AI-assisted summary
Interaction design is a discipline focused on creating usable and effective interactive products that consider users' abilities and needs. It emphasizes achieving key usability goals like effectiveness, efficiency, and learnability while recognizing that micro-interactions significantly impact overall user satisfaction.

Beyond usability alone, interaction design prioritizes the holistic user experience, acknowledging that even technically usable products can fail if they incorporate dark patterns or misalign with users' mental models. The discipline builds upon interaction science, which studies the fundamental principles governing human-technology relationships, with the ultimate goal of creating intuitive interfaces that match users' conceptual understanding of how a system should work.
