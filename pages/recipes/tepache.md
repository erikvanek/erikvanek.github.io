description: Tepache - one of the funkiest fermented drinks made from leftover pineapple rind and core. Ideal for winter time.

---

Wonderful spicy refreshing drink born in Mexico. You can give a second life to your usually thrown away pineapple skins & core. It ferments really well even in standard winter room temperature.

It takes less then a week to get this amazing winter refreshment ready to enjoy. Fun fact is that you can get more flushes from one pineapple. To me personally it seems that even a 3rd flush is pretty potent, 4th one is starting to weaken a bit.

All you need is to have a fresh pineapple and a jar that can be sealed well. I like to use a mason jar with a rubber seal. This keeps your content almost air tight to support the fermentation but still allows it to burp when needed.

## Ingredients

_(I'm using 4l mason jar)_

- 1 pineapple (preferably organic)
- 1 habanero (seeds in or out depending on how spicy you want to go)
- 2 thumb sized ginger chunks
- 8 cloves
- 2 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 200g brown sugar
- water (usually 2,5 - 3l)

## How to?

### Prep work

- twist off pineapple top & [plant it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4iDBK0U6po&ab_channel=DIYHomeandGarden) :)
- scrub & wash your pineapple thoroughly (especially if you don't have an organic one)
- trim off bottom & top 2cm discs & discard those
- [peel & core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETIUK15L2l0&ab_channel=How2Heroes) pineapple by cutting off its skin off vertically strip by strip
  - I prefer to use bread knife for this
  - save flesh for eating (I like to throw say 1/8 of pineapple flesh into tepache tho)
  - skin & core is used for making tepache
  - I like to cut skins & core even a bit more - halve cores & skin strips once again so that they are easier to work with
- halve (& potentially seed) your habanero

### Assembly

- place suger to the container and dilute with the same amount of hot water
- add spices, ginger, habanero & finally pineapple bits
- top with fresh room temp water leaving 3cm of head space
- close well & put somewhere without direct sunlight preferably with stable temperature

### Final steps

- I like to ferment mine in a standard winter room temperature (~20Â° Celsius) for around three days
- once feremented, strain content & reserve the liquid
  - try to press as much liquid out of your ingredients as possible
- bottle liquid preferably into flip top bottles leaving 3cm headspace
- leave for another 3 days in room temperature to perform 2nd fermentation - this step brings some bubbles in the game
- after second fermentation chill your bottles & once chilled - enjoy!
- you can do multiple flushes from one pineapple
  - once bottled, put yet another 200g of sugar & dissolve into your container, add your pineapple & spices & start over
  - usually second batch is even better than the first one - it is not as spicy, but way bubblier, third one is quite good as well, 4th batch seems to be a bit weak tho
