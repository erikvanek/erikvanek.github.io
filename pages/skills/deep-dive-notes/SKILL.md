# Deep Dive Notes Processor

Transcribe handwritten multi-source research notes into structured Obsidian notes.

## Trigger

User says "process deep dive notes" and provides either:
- A PDF file (reMarkable export)
- Multiple image files (photos of paper notes)

## Language

Notes may be in **Czech or English**. Preserve the original language throughout. Do not translate.

## Workflow

### 1. Convert and Transcribe

**For PDF input:**
```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
images = convert_from_path('notes.pdf', dpi=150)
for i, img in enumerate(images):
    img.save(f'page_{i+1}.png', 'PNG')
```

**For image input:**
Accept images directly and process in order.

Then visually read and transcribe each page.

### 2. Verify Content Type

Deep dive notes contain **multiple sources** (multiple H1 headings), each representing a different article, video, or resource.

If user provides single-source notes, suggest: "This looks like single-source book notes. Should I use 'process book notes' instead?"

### 3. Apply Formatting Rules

See `../shared/formatting-rules.md` for complete conventions. Key rules:

- `!` at bullet start → *italics*
- `!!!` at bullet start → **bold**
- Underscored words → **bold**
- Numbered sequences → numbered lists
- H1 (`#`) marks source titles
- Quotes: `Author: *"Quote text"*`

### 4. Collect Metadata

Ask user for:
- **Resources list** (URLs to original sources)

Then query Obsidian for existing tags:
```
obsidian-mcp-tools:search_vault_simple with relevant keywords
```
Select 3-5 tags that match the vault's existing taxonomy.

### 5. Generate Summary

If transcribed content exceeds ~1 A4 of text, generate a 1-3 paragraph summary covering:
- Core tension or theme
- Key frameworks or approaches
- Critical questions or insights

Place summary after frontmatter, before raw transcription.

### 6. Build Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: [Derived from content or user input]
date_created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
source_type: research
tags:
  - [3-5 relevant tags from vault]
resources:
  - [URL 1]
  - [URL 2]
---
```

### 7. Handle Quotes

If transcription contains quotes (format: `Author: "Quote text"`):

In transcription:
```markdown
- Author: *"Quote text"*
```

Append to Obsidian quotes file `10 - 🧠 Knowledge/3 - 📚 Resources/Learning/Quotes.md`:
```markdown
- Author: "Quote text"
```

### 8. Save to Obsidian

Create file in inbox: `02 - 📩 Inbox/[Title].md`

Use `obsidian-mcp-tools:create_vault_file` with the complete markdown content.

### 9. Add Related Notes

Query Obsidian for related existing notes and add a `## Related notes` section with wiki-links at the end.

## Output Structure

```markdown
---
[frontmatter]
---

## Summary

[AI-generated summary if content is long enough]

---

# From "[Source 1]"

- [transcribed bullets with formatting]
- *important point*
- **very important point**
- Author: *"Quote text"*

# From "[Source 2]"

...

## Related notes

- [[Related Note 1]]
- [[Related Note 2]]
```
