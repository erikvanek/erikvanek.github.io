I like to do stuff. Grow greens [for example](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

## Who am I?

That's a good one. Glad you ask. Trying to find out lately. At least 20 years.

Overgrown brat? Hopefully not.

Professionally software developer for several years. Wannabe designer, hobby cook. Sometimes constructive hater. Loyal person. You need to earn this loyalty though. I love my family, friends, sports and good sleep. Food indeed.

Wanto to se those _hard skills_? Feel free to scan through my [CV](/docs/erik-vanek-cv.pdf).

### What do I like?
- honesty,
- food that makes sense (simple, seasonal, local, ...),
- understanding root causes of things,
- challenging status quo,
- decisiveness,
- creative wordplay.

### What I do not like?
- bullshit,
- improper tooling (e.g. dull knives),
- stereotypes,
- meal vouchers,
- "But we've always done it this way" mindset,
- overcooked pasta.
