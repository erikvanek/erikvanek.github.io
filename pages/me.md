## What I'm up to?

-   food
-   tech
-   design
-   being out

Since 2013, I have worked mainly in the software industry wearing multiple hats. Most recently I was part of [infarm](https://www.infarm.com/){target="_blank"} for more than four years. I was contributing to its hydroponic farm controlling services as an engineer, team lead and a designer at times. Also helped to kick-off a vertical team initiative that was aiming to disrupt companies' mostly siloed team structure.  Currently I'm working as a designer of social innovations for several projects supported by the Ministry of social affairs in Prague.

## In 2022 I was also

-   brewing [kombucha](/kombucha) and fermenting things a lot
-   doing a bit of [creative coding](/pudem-pudem) (it is broken now, need to fix it :))
-   volunteering in [Práh](https://www.prahjm.cz/){target="_blank"}, [Vesna](https://spolekvesna.cz/){target="_blank"} and [ADRA](https://adra.cz/){target="_blank"}
-   ensuring [Sonda festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4JHn8dAfMg&ab_channel=SONDAFestival) runs smoothly
-   part of [Trychtýř collective](https://svitava.org/udalost/open-call-trychtyr/), see my [intro slides](/trychtyr){target="_blank"}
-   growing greens using my [aeroponics](/aero) setup
-   co-curating a [Gallery of Architecture](https://www.galeriearchitekturybrno.cz/){target="_blank"}
- finishing my journey at [infarm](https://www.infarm.com){target="_blank"}

<!-- I like to do stuff. [Growing greens aeroponically](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

Working professionally as a software developer for several years capable of wearing a designer or a product hat. Otherwise you'll find me cooking often, fermenting things and spending my time outside preferably.

### What do I like?

- honesty,
- simple & seasonal food,
- understanding root causes of things,
- decisiveness,
- creative wordplay.
- independent musicians (see [my wishlist](https://bandcamp.com/falsepositive/wishlist))

### What I do not like?

- bullshit and playing games,
- improper tooling (e.g. dull knives),
- stereotypes,
- "But we've always done it this way" mindset,
- overcooked pasta.
