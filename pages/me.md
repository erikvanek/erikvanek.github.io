## What I'm up to?

-   food
-   tech
-   design
-   being out

I've been around in mainly software industry since 2013 wearing multiple hats. Most recently I was part of [infarm](https://www.infarm.com/) for more than four years. I was contributing to its hydroponic farm controlling services as an engineer, team lead and a designer at times. Also helped to kick-off a vertical team initiative that was aiming to disrupt companies' mostly siloed team structure. After being impacted by [restructuring](https://www.infarm.com/news/note-from-infarm-s-founders-strategy-shift-and-profitability-at-infarm) in late 2022 I'm enjoying my garden leave until I decide what is my next journey to embark on. More structured CV available [here](../documents/Erik-Vanek-cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## In 2022 I was also

-   brewing [kombucha](/kombucha) and fermenting things a lot
-   doing a bit of [creative coding](https://www.erikvanek.com/pudem-pudem/) (some presets need a MIDI controller)
-   volunteering in [Práh](https://www.prahjm.cz/), [Vesna](https://spolekvesna.cz/) and [ADRA](https://www.prahjm.cz/)
-   ensuring [Sonda festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4JHn8dAfMg&ab_channel=SONDAFestival) runs smoothly
-   part of [Trychtýř collective](https://svitava.org/udalost/open-call-trychtyr/), see my [intro slides](http://www.erikvanek.com/trychtyr/)
-   growing greens using my [aeroponics](/aero) setup
-   co-curating a [Gallery of Architecture](https://www.galeriearchitekturybrno.cz/)

<!-- I like to do stuff. [Growing greens aeroponically](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

Working professionally as a software developer for several years capable of wearing a designer or a product hat. Otherwise you'll find me cooking often, fermenting things and spending my time outside preferably.
