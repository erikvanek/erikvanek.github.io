I like to do stuff. [Growing greens aeroponically](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

Professionally software developer for several years. Wannabe designer, hobby cook, constructive hater & hopefully a loyal person. I love my family, friends, sports, good food & sleep. I like mid-sized cities with around a half of milion population like <abbr title="If you ever visit, instead of saying 'Hi', use 'Zdarec' [zdareds].">Brno</abbr>, Copenhagen or Wrocław. You can also check some [articles I like](/links).

Wanto to se those _hard skills_? Feel free to scan through my [CV](/documents/erik-vanek-cv.pdf). It is a bit dated though.

### What do I like?
- honesty,
- simple & seasonal food,
- understanding root causes of things,
- decisiveness,
- creative wordplay.
- independent musicians (see [my wishlist](https://bandcamp.com/falsepositive/wishlist))

### What I do not like?
- bullshit and playing games,
- improper tooling (e.g. dull knives),
- stereotypes,
- "But we've always done it this way" mindset,
- overcooked pasta.
