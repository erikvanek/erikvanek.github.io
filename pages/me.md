I like to do stuff. Grow greens [for example](/aero/) or develop on the [web](/development/).

Professionally software developer for several years. Wannabe designer, hobby cook. Sometimes constructive hater. Loyal person. I love my family, friends, sports and good sleep. Food indeed.

Wanto to se those _hard skills_? Feel free to scan through my [CV](/documents/erik-vanek-cv.pdf).

### What do I like?
- honesty,
- food that makes sense (simple, seasonal, local, ...),
- understanding root causes of things,
- challenging status quo,
- decisiveness,
- creative wordplay.
- independent musicians (see [my wishlist](https://bandcamp.com/falsepositive/wishlist))

### What I do not like?
- bullshit,
- improper tooling (e.g. dull knives),
- stereotypes,
- meal vouchers,
- "But we've always done it this way" mindset,
- overcooked pasta.
