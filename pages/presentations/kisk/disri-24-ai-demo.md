#1 

You are helping me prototype a simple task prioritization web app that allows dragging and dropping tasks between priority quadrants. I'm seeking a responsive, single-page application using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). The code should be clean, well-commented, and browser-compatible. Each task should be draggable, and the interface should be intuitive for users with no technical background.

The first step is:
"
Create an HTML page with a 2x2 grid representing a task priority matrix. Label quadrants as 'Urgent & Important', 'Not Urgent & Important', 'Urgent & Not Important', and 'Not Urgent & Not Important'. Add a text input and button to create new draggable task items."

Give me an output as one Claude artifact so that I can just simplz copy and paste to my code editor

#2

"Update the matrix to use a clean modern design. Make quadrants visually distinct with different background colors. Add hover effects on draggable items. Use a nice sans-serif font and add subtle shadows to elements."

#3

"Add these features to the matrix:
* Task items should show a grabbing cursor on hover
* Add a delete button on each task
* Make tasks persist in local storage
* Add a counter showing number of tasks in each quadrant
* Tasks should animate smoothly when dragged"
