A set of links that I found at some points interesting and inspiring.

## Tech

- [The tyranny of convenience](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html) is a nice one about gig economy, hedonic adaptation, premium apps etc
- [The dark side of dark mode](https://tidbits.com/2019/05/31/the-dark-side-of-dark-mode/) discusses current trend in using dark theme in applications and disputes its trendiness.
- [Dark sides of NFT](https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3) which for some reason seems to be quite a hot topic in early 2021

## Design

- [Scaling down](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872617300552) talks about a possible paradigm shift when dealing with projects that do not aim to reach a global potential

## Teamwork

- [This is the one skill designers need to develop most in 2020](https://medium.com/fast-company/this-is-the-one-skill-designers-need-to-develop-most-in-2020-c0ee1bb82955) - I believe this one applies to all contemporary white collar labor. Bridging silos seems to be one of the most challenging disciplins when working in cross-department environments. The skill of 'letting go' can open so many doors while insisting on your undebateable truths can close some of them forever.
