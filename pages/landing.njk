            Turning a vision into reality can be challenging. I bring diverse
            experience from tech startups to public services and NGOs, helping
            organizations overcome obstacles and find new opportunities.

                <p>
                    Understanding your clients' true needs. I design services by
                    listening to your clients, observing their behavior, and
                    addressing their pain points. This ensures solutions truly
                    work for them.

                <p>
                    Focusing on what matters most. I help identify and tackle
                    the most crucial tasks first, always keeping your long-term
                    goals in mind. This approach maximizes impact and
                    efficiency.

                    Enhancing through quick feedback. Regular check-ins help
                    test ideas and solve issues early. Services grow in sync
                    with your vision and client needs.

        <h2>Words into actions</h2>
        <p>
            One-size-fits-all solutions rarely work. That's why I begin each
            project by getting to know your organization inside and out. We'll
            map processes, identify pain points, and uncover hidden potential.

            <p>
                There's a lack of childcare facilities for kids under 6 years of
                age. I've helped the Ministry of social welfare to deliver a
                home-based childcare service.
