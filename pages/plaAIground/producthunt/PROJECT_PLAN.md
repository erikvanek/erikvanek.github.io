## ðŸ”„ Pivot Points

If metrics aren't met:

| Problem | Pivot Option |
|---------|--------------|
| LLM too expensive | Use only embeddings + keyword matching |
| Crawling difficult | Manual product entry for 1 category first |
| Users don't like chat | Filter-based UI instead |
| Low relevance | Add human-in-the-loop verification |
| 3D models unavailable | Partner with modeling services |

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Data Collection  
**Progress:** 20% (Project setup complete)  
**Next Milestone:** Working Siko.cz crawler  
**Blocker:** None
