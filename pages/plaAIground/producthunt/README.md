# 🎨 Interior Design Product Discovery Tool

> AI-powered product search for Czech interior architects - Stop wasting hours browsing e-shops!

## The Problem

Interior architects spend **30-40% of project time** manually:
- 🔍 Browsing 10-20+ e-commerce sites
- 📸 Taking screenshots and managing tabs
- 📏 Checking if products match specifications
- 🎭 Hunting for 3D models for SketchUp
- 💬 Creating presentations for clients

## Our Solution

**One tool that:**
1. 📤 Understands your moodboard and design intent (via AI)
2. 🔎 Searches across 5 Czech e-shops simultaneously
3. 💬 Refines results through conversation
4. 🎲 Flags 3D model availability instantly

## Target E-Shops (Czech Market)

| Site | Focus | Why Important |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Siko** | Bathrooms, kitchens, tiles | Market leader in bathrooms |
| **Baumax** | Home improvement, flooring | Comprehensive catalog |
| **Hornbach** | DIY, building materials | Great for fixtures |
| **XXXLutz** | Furniture | Largest furniture retailer |
| **Sconto** | Budget furniture | Good price range |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
npm install
npx playwright install  # Install browser dependencies

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

# Run crawler (get products from e-shops)
npm run crawl:siko        # Test run (10 products)
npm run crawl:siko:full   # Full crawl (all products)

# Test AI systems
npm run test:moodboard    # Test moodboard analysis
npm run enrich:products   # Add AI style tags to products
npm run generate:embeddings # Create product embeddings
npm run test:search       # Test product matching engine

# Start backend API
npm run dev:api          # Development with auto-reload
npm run start:api        # Production server
npm run test:api         # Test all API endpoints

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
npm run dev:frontend      # React development server (localhost:5173)

# View the application
# Backend API: http://localhost:3000
# Frontend UI:  http://localhost:5173
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **LLM:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (moodboard analysis) + Haiku (basic tasks)
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone or local ChromaDB
- **Scraping:** Playwright + Cheerio
- **Database:** SQLite (prototype) → PostgreSQL (production)

## Cost Estimates

### Development ✅ **Achieved**
- Prototype: **$30-50** (includes testing & iteration) ✅ **Under budget at ~$25**

### Production ✅ **Better than target**
- Per user session: **$0.01-0.02** (10x better than original target!)
- Moodboard analysis: **$0.01** per image
- Product enrichment: **$0.001** per product (one-time)
- Search operations: **Free** (local processing)
- For 100 users: **~$2-5/month** (4x cheaper than planned!)

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1: Setup & Data Collection**
✅ **Phase 2: LLM Integration**

## Development Workflow

1. **Always read** `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` first if you're a Claude agent
2. **Check current phase** in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
3. **Run tests** before committing: `npm test`
4. **Document changes** in relevant README files
5. **Track costs** - we're optimizing for <$0.15 per session
