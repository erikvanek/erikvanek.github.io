# Claude Agent Context - Interior Design Product Discovery Tool

## 🎯 PROJECT MISSION
Build an AI-powered web tool that helps Czech interior architects find products (furniture, fixtures, lighting) that match their design vision by:
1. Understanding moodboards and project briefs using LLM
2. Searching across multiple Czech e-commerce sites
3. Providing conversational refinement of results
4. Flagging 3D model availability for SketchUp

## 🎨 THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
Interior architects waste 30-40% of project time manually browsing 10-20+ e-shops, taking screenshots, checking if products match specs (dimensions, budget, style), then hunting for 3D models separately. This tool eliminates that friction.

## 🏪 TARGET E-COMMERCE SITES (Czech Market)
1. **Siko** (siko.cz) - Bathrooms, kitchens, tiles, flooring
2. **Baumax** (baumax.cz) - Home improvement, flooring, tiles
3. **Hornbach** (hornbach.cz) - DIY, building materials, sanitary
4. **XXXLutz** (xxxlutz.cz) - Furniture (sofas, beds, tables)
5. **Sconto** (sconto-nabytek.cz) - Furniture warehouse

## 🔄 USER WORKFLOW
```
1. User uploads moodboard images + project brief
2. LLM extracts "design DNA" (style, colors, materials, mood)
3. User enters constraints (budget, dimensions, category)
4. System matches products from database
5. User refines via chat: "warmer tones", "more minimalist", etc.
6. System shows refined results with 3D model availability
```

## 💰 COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY
- **Use embeddings** for cheap product matching (pennies)
- **Claude Haiku** for basic tasks ($0.25/M tokens)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** only for moodboard analysis and conversational refinement
- **Prompt caching** for repeated system prompts
- Target: $0.10-0.15 per user session

- Match relevance: > 80% user satisfaction
- Cost per session: < $0.15
- 3D model availability: > 40% of products flagged

## 🔀 PIVOT POINTS
If something doesn't work, here are easy pivots:
1. **LLM too expensive?** → Use only embeddings + keyword matching
2. **Crawling too hard?** → Start with manual product entry for 1 category
3. **Users don't like chat?** → Switch to filter-based UI
4. **Czech market too small?** → Expand to EU/English sites
5. **3D models unavailable?** → Partner with 3D modeling services

## 💡 WHEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT
- **Always check** the current phase in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **Read** implementation notes in relevant /src folders
- **Test locally** before committing
- **Document** any API changes or new prompts
- **Keep costs low** - use Haiku for dev, Sonnet for production
