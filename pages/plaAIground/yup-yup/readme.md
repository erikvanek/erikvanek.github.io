# Snap

Snap helps you to take notes while your hands are busy. Like when you're cleaning windows, making pesto or you're simply jogging.

## How it works?
- You connect Snap with your Spotify account
- once connected, you can turn Snap's listening feature
- once listening, everytime you say 'Snap', you can record a note which is automatically transcripted to text
- if you say 'Snap' again, Snap automatically resumes the podcast
- if you say 'Rewind' it rewinds the podcast 30 seconds
- at the end of the session, you can easily export notes in a standalone markdown file
