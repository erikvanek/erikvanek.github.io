### 1. Download Required Libraries

The extension needs two JavaScript libraries. Download them and place them in the `libs/` folder:

**a) JSZip (for creating ZIP files)**
- Go to: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js
- Save as: `libs/jszip.min.js`

**b) html2pdf.js (for PDF generation)**
- Go to: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2pdf.js/0.10.1/html2pdf.bundle.min.js
- Save as: `libs/html2pdf.bundle.min.js`

### 2. Create Icons

You need to create placeholder icons or the extension won't load. Create simple PNG files:

- `icons/icon-16.png` (16x16px) - gray icon
- `icons/icon-16-active.png` (16x16px) - green icon
- `icons/icon-48.png` (48x48px) - gray icon
- `icons/icon-48-active.png` (48x48px) - green icon
- `icons/icon-128.png` (128x128px) - gray icon
- `icons/icon-128-active.png` (128x128px) - green icon

**Quick way to create icons:**
1. Open any image editor (Preview on Mac, Paint on Windows)
2. Create a 128x128px image with a solid color (gray for inactive, green for active)
3. Add text "MU" or "ðŸ“¥" in the center
4. Resize/save copies as 16x16 and 48x48
5. Save in the `icons/` folder
