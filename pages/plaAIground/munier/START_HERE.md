## ⚠️ What You Need to Do Before Testing

The extension code is **100% complete**, but you need to add 2 things:

### 1. Download Libraries (5 minutes)

**Option A - Automatic (easiest):**
```bash
cd /Users/erik/dev/erikvanek.github.io/pages/plaAIground/munier
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Option B - Manual:**
1. Download: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js
   → Save as: `libs/jszip.min.js`

2. Download: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2pdf.js/0.10.1/html2pdf.bundle.min.js
   → Save as: `libs/html2pdf.bundle.min.js`

### 2. Create Icons (2 minutes)

**Easiest way:**
1. Open `icon-generator.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Move the 6 PNG files to the `icons/` folder

**Alternative:**
Use any image editor to create 6 simple PNG files (see SETUP.md for details)

## 🚀 Loading the Extension

Once you have libraries + icons:

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `munier` folder
6. Done! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing

1. Navigate to: https://is.muni.cz (log in)
2. Go to any curriculum page (with `index.qwarp` in URL)
3. Extension icon should **turn green** ✅
4. Click the extension icon
5. Click "Download Curriculum"
6. Wait for processing
7. Save the ZIP file

### Expected Output:
```
DESB54-Learning_Design.zip
├── DESB54-Learning_Design.pdf
└── resources/
    ├── audio_file.mp3
    ├── image_file.png
    ├── document.pdf
    └── ...
```

## 📚 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. You visit IS MU curriculum page
2. Extension detects page → icon turns green 🟢
3. You click extension → popup opens
4. You click "Download Curriculum" → processing starts
5. Extension:
   - Extracts all curriculum content
   - Downloads all resources (images, PDFs, audio, video)
   - Generates PDF with curriculum content
   - Creates ZIP with PDF + resources folder
   - Handles filename collisions (adds _(1), _(2), etc.)
6. ZIP downloads automatically

### Technical Details:
- **Pure JavaScript** - No frameworks, no external APIs
- **Privacy-focused** - Everything runs locally in your browser
- **Offline-first** - Once downloaded, works without internet
- **Smart naming** - Resources named by their link text
- **Error handling** - Graceful failures with user feedback

---

## 🎓 Sharing with Classmates

When ready to share:

1. **Test thoroughly** on different curricula
2. **Package everything:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/erik/dev/erikvanek.github.io/pages/plaAIground
   zip -r munier-extension.zip munier/
   ```
3. **Share the ZIP** with installation instructions
4. **Help them** download libraries and create icons
5. **Celebrate** 🎉

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Audio/video streams (.m3u8) are linked in PDF, not downloaded
- Very large curricula might take time to process
- Some resources might fail if authentication is required
- Works only while logged into IS MU

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (See TODO.md)

- Better icon design with MU branding
- Option to download only PDF (skip resources)
- Batch download multiple curricula
- Convert .m3u8 streams to MP3/MP4
- Generate EPUB format
- Dark mode UI
