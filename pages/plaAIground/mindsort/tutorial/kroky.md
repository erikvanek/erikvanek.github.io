I want you to scrape to the bone two websites I give you as an attachement.

One is a registry of social services in my region, the other one is a registry of health services in whole country.

I want you to scrape all different types of services those two pillars serve to their clients and customers and then we do something more with it.

Display those services you scraped as a coma-separated list of services.

OK so that's quite a of categories.

I want you to reduce them to some broader categories based on similarity, say 20-30 tops.

And then from those categories create an interactive single page website that is an interactive card-sorting game which starts with user seeing all those categories. And then by intuitively combing them they can combine and thus categories of services.

# 3
add a feature that allows to name each cluster

# 4
add a feature that allows to send the results of the categorization to an email address 'kemboi@ezekiel.yup'

# 5
Add a visual cue to nudge users to create between 6-8 categories. Use mild tones of pastel colors and add a counter that nudges positively to create more categories if there are less than 6. Be playful in copyrighting and use some sort of gratification pattern when there are 3, 2 and 1 category remaining to 6.

# 6
Add a feature to delete a category while the service stays in the list. Also each category should have a slightly different color. Try to use some nice font as 'Roboto' or something like that and give a site a better visual rhythm.

# 7
Give a bit more understandable guidance to the user. Maybe consider using bullet points or emojis. Consider some funky name instead of this generic headline.

# 8
When sending the email the body should include three open-ended quesions in bullet points - one is about why they decided for such categorization, the other one is if they're missing some category and the third one is if they want to know the results once we gather together results.

# 9
make it mobile friendly

# 10
Make sure that each newly created category has a unique name to the other so that when we stringify it later it does not lose groups with same default name. Maybe use something like "group1, group2, ...".

Also when sending results prompt user to enter their name and include that name into the signature of that mail with results.

OK there's a bug when you double click the card nothing happens, can you try again? And print the whole code block again.
