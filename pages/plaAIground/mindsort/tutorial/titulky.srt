00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
1. Scrape two websites: registry of social services in your region and health services nationwide. Extract all types of services.
2. Reduce the scraped categories to 20-30 broader categories based on similarity.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Create an interactive single-page website for a card-sorting game. Users start by seeing all categories and can intuitively combine them.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,200
Add a feature that allows users to name each cluster of categories they create during the card-sorting process.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Implement a feature to send the results of the categorization to the email address 'kemboi@ezekiel.yup' for analysis.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Add visual cues to encourage 6-8 categories. Use mild pastel colors and a counter to nudge users. Be playful in copywriting and use gratification patterns.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
Add a feature to delete categories while keeping services in the list. Use different colors for each category. Implement 'Roboto' font and improve visual rhythm.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Provide clearer guidance to users. Consider using bullet points or emojis. Replace the generic headline with a more engaging, funky name.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
When sending the email, include three open-ended questions about categorization choices, missing categories, and interest in overall results.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Ensure the website is mobile-friendly to accommodate users on various devices and screen sizes.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Ensure each new category has a unique name (e.g., "group1", "group2"). Prompt users for their name and include it in the email signature with results.
