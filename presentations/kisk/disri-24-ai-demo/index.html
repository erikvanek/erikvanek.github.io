<p>You are helping me prototype a simple task prioritization web app that allows dragging and dropping tasks between priority quadrants. I'm seeking a responsive, single-page application using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). The code should be clean, well-commented, and browser-compatible. Each task should be draggable, and the interface should be intuitive for users with no technical background.</p>
<p>The first step is:<br>
&quot;<br>
Create an HTML page with a 2x2 grid representing a task priority matrix. Label quadrants as 'Urgent &amp; Important', 'Not Urgent &amp; Important', 'Urgent &amp; Not Important', and 'Not Urgent &amp; Not Important'. Add a text input and button to create new draggable task items.&quot;</p>
<p>Give me an output as one Claude artifact so that I can just simplz copy and paste to my code editor</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>&quot;Update the matrix to use a clean modern design. Make quadrants visually distinct with different background colors. Add hover effects on draggable items. Use a nice sans-serif font and add subtle shadows to elements.&quot;</p>
<p>#3</p>
<p>&quot;Add these features to the matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task items should show a grabbing cursor on hover</li>
<li>Add a delete button on each task</li>
<li>Make tasks persist in local storage</li>
<li>Add a counter showing number of tasks in each quadrant</li>
<li>Tasks should animate smoothly when dragged&quot;</li>
</ul>
